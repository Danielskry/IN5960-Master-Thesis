[SAK-150] Worksite Setup: Course Site: Odd behavior when site is not published,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-150,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>I am on nightly with the 'admin' username.  These are the steps I am taking:</p>

<p>1. Click 'Worksite Setup' and then Click 'New...'.<br/>
2. Select 'Course website' and keep default Academic Term 'Fall 2004', then click 'Continue'.<br/>
3. Enter 'Psych' for 'Subject', '101' for 'Course', '002' for Sections' and 'admin' for 'authorizer's username', then click 'Continue'.<br/>
4. Enter 'Test for Kris' for 'Description' and 'Test for Kris' for 'Short Description', then click 'Continue'.<br/>
5. Select the following Tools:</p>

<p>Home<br/>
Schedule<br/>
Announcements<br/>
Resources<br/>
Discussion<br/>
Assignments<br/>
Drop Box<br/>
Chat Room</p>

<p>then click 'Continue'.</p>

<p>6. I leave the defaults set on the Site Status screen, so 'Publish site' is not checked, and 'Display my site in the directory, and share files I select' is selected.  I then click 'Continue'.<br/>
7. I click 'Create Site'.</p>

<p>Problem # 1: At this point, I am redirected to the Worksite setup entry screen.  I can see the ID for the course I just created in the list of Worksites, but there is no tab listed for this site.</p>

<p>I copy the site ID and paste it in the link at the top, so the link is as follows:</p>

<p><a href=""http://sakai-sand1.uits.iupui.edu/portal/site/1106260734575-97"" class=""external-link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://sakai-sand1.uits.iupui.edu/portal/site/1106260734575-97</a></p>

<p>Problem # 2: I then hit enter on my keyboard.  I can now see the tab for this site, but on the left where I would expect to see the tools, I see a white box with a red exclamation point and text right beside the exclamation point that says 'Unpublished site'.  I'm pretty sure I've been able to create unpublished sites in the past and as the maintainer of the course I can see the tools in the site, but I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Problem # 3: At this point, I return to 'My Workspace' where I select 'Worksite Setup', check the box next to the '1106260734575-97' site and click 'Revise'.  I then click 'Site Access' and check the box next to 'Publish site' and then click 'Update'.  Now when I go to the tab for my new site, I no longer see the 'Unpublished site' message, but I don't have any tools either.  So, if I go back to 'My Workspace', 'Worksite Setup', check the box next to the '1106260734575-97' site and click 'Revise'.  I then click 'Edit tools', check the same tools that I checked in 'Worksite Setup' and click 'Continue' and then 'Finish', now when I go to the tab for my new site I see the tools.</p>

<p>I probably should have reported this as three separate problems, but I wanted you to see the flow.

That is caused entirely by Microsoft Word + Internet Explorer, and is related to the double-spacing bug when text is typed into the WYSIWYG editor.  This is not easy to fix since it involves working around Microsoft's bugs.  HTMLArea itself does not solve this fully.</p>

[SAK-35240] Question-level feedback not always showing up: SA questions,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-35240,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p><a href=""http://aam-dev:8080/samigo/jsf/author/item/shortAnswer.faces"" class=""external-link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://aam-dev:8080/samigo/jsf/author/item/shortAnswer.faces</a></p>

<p>Action: Created several questions of all types in ""My Assessments"" section, viewed.  </p>

<p>Result: Question-level feedback for Short Answer questions is not always displayed or saved.   </p>

<p>The first couple of questions I created did display feedback.  I've now created 9 total questions, and the last 4 of all types have been missing question-level feedback. So it may take several attempts to reproduce the bug, but it should be reproducible.</p>

<p>Worksite created by admin<br/>
Daffy accesses the worksite using the ""test"" role (one created by admin)</p>

<p>""test"" role has all the discussion permissions checked EXCEPT for disc.read.drafts.</p>

<p>1.  daffy creates a new discussion category ""Grading"" with one discussion<br/>
    item<br/>
2.  daffy creates a new discussion category ""Homework"" with a draft item<br/>
3.  admin creates a discussion item with existing category ""Grading"" <br/>
4.  admin creates a new discussion category ""Quiz"" with one draft item </p>

<p>Daffy sees regular items and draft items created by daffy only.<br/>
Although daffy is unable to see the draft item created by admin, daffy is able to see the category ""Quiz"" and to delete the category.  When daffy deletes the category, neither admin nor daffy see the category nor the draft item in it. When admin select the ""New Topic"" button, the dropdown list for ""Category"" no longer has ""Quiz"" in the list.  SO FAR SO GOOD.</p>

<p>5.  admin creates a new discussion category ""Quiz"" with one draft item.</p>

<p>The PREVIOUS draft item as well as the new draft item show up on the admin screen.  Daffy still only sees the category, not the items, since disc.read.drafts is not checked for daffy's ""test"" role.</p>

<p>6.  daffy deletes the category ""Quiz.""</p>

<p>Again, the category is deleted on daffy's screen, and the category and draft items are removed from the admin screen.</p>

<p>7.  admin creates a new category ""Let me out!!!"" with one draft item</p>

<p>Everything is as it should be.</p>

<p>8.  admin creates a new category ""Quiz"" with one draft item</p>

<p>Admin sees the ""Quiz"" category with THREE draft items.</p>

[SAK-36299] Assessment settings:  metadata recording,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-36299,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p><a href=""http://aam-dev:8080/samigo/jsf/author/editAssessment.faces"" class=""external-link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://aam-dev:8080/samigo/jsf/author/editAssessment.faces</a></p>

<p>The last section in assessment settings, for Metadata, has checkboxes for ""Record Metadata for Parts"" and ""Record Metadata for Questions""</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>If the box for Questions metadata is checked,  you can then save data for each question in the objective, keyword and rubric fields.  If the box is <b>not</b> checked, those fields still show up for every question, and you can put data in them - but it's not saved.</p>

<p>It's very confusing to have fields be available for text entry and then lose any text you type in them.   Is it possible to have those fields greyed out, or absent,  in assessments where the ""record metadata for questions"" box is not checked?   (Or, if that's too much trouble, just have that setting always be on? ) </p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>What does the ""record metadata for parts"" checkbox accomplish?  There is a comment field and a title field for each part/section of an assessment, but text typed there gets saved whether or not the checkbox in assessment settings is marked.  So what's it supposed to do?

"[SAK-139] Support for the vocabularly different schools use, e.g., Semester vs. Term vs. Quarter",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-139,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Support for the variety of ""academic"" vocabularies used by different schools can be handled through a properties file.  For instance, at the University of Michigan, uniquname, is generally used as the noun for ""username"", because it is a term that has strong recogniztion and meaning to the U-M user base.  Text in the Sakai interface should draw the locale-specific word for username from a properties file.  Defining the text during deployment will probably capture most cases, however, run-time substitution maybe desired for situations where skinning the words is appropriate (e.g., a Sakai installation shared by multiple universities with differing vocabularies.)</p>

<p>Other examples of variations, where word-for-word substitution would be useful could include:  Class/Course, Semester/Quarter/Term, Credit/Unit,  Login-Logout/Log On-Log Off, etc.  There are probably other vocabulary variations that cannot be treated as simple word substitutions, however, it would be nice to at least gather them together in one place or somehow flag them so an institution can edit them while deploying, rather than having to discover them on their own.</p>",,28614,SAK-139,"Support for the vocabularly different schools use, e.g., Semester vs. Term vs. Quarter",10017,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10318&avatarType=issuetype,Task,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

[SAK-129] URL to worksite in Email Messages,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-129,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>When an email messages is sent to a worksite, and forwarded out to the participants, it does not contain a link to the worksite.  This can be problematic if the user wants to follow-up by visiting the worksite, and they cannot tell from which worksite the email orginated.  All they have to go on is the from address, which they may not recognize.</p>

<p>It would be better to include a link to the worksite in the email.  This would also enable to user to get to the worksite in one-step, rather than having to open their navigate their browser to Sakai and then navigate within Sakai to the worksite.</p>

<p>While such email does have a unique ""from"" address, as users begin to participate in many different worksites, and perhaps some not all too often, then they may not recognize that address.  It may also be the case that no email alias was set for the group, so all the user has to go on is a long, unmemorable, unique numerical ID.  The content of the email may also be inconclusive in helping the user identify the worksite, as they maybe involved in several related sites or the context may not be uniquely recognizable.  It is often the case as well that the name chosen for the email alias is not a direct reflection of the title of the worksite.</p>

<p>A link to the worksite in the email should probably take the user directly to the home page for the worksite.  Such a URL would be relatively short and less likely to fall victim to line-wrapping problems.  Another possibility would be to link directly to the message as displayed in the Email Archive tool view in the worksite, under the presumption that something in the email caught the user's attention and they wish to see the rest of the thread.</p>

<p>The link could be put in a header or footer on the email.  It looks like we currently append everything at the bottom of the email, so perhaps it would should go there.  However, since this is mostly a navigational element, then perhaps it should go in a header at the start of the message.</p>",All,28610,SAK-129,URL to worksite in Email Messages,10012,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10315&avatarType=issuetype,Feature Request,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>That seems completely reasonable behaviour, as making the site joinable means its open to anyone.</p>

<p>If the requirement is to be able to blacklist somebody from a site such that he/she can never rejoin even when the site is joinable, then I think that should be a separate feature request.</p>

It can be fixed by carefully going through the code and making the necessary changes.  Folks could certainly vote on the priority for this if such a process existed.  This has not been worked on because there has always been something that was higher priority so far.</p>

[SAK-112] Import does not create custom fields in Schedule,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-112,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>I had developed my course in an old 1.0 site named ""S544 Demo.""  I used Sakai's capabilities to create additional fields in the Schedule - this is a *<b>GREAT</b>* feature for faculty - to add three custom fields: Learning Objectives, Class Prep Guidance, and Readings.  I chose not to put all of this in the rich text editor Description Field as when you put a lot of text there, it reduces the utility of the View ""List of Events"" as they are all too long.</p>

<p>You guys used an admin tool to export and import the courses into three new 1.5 sections.</p>

<p>I was horrified to see that the three User Fields and all the content did <b>not</b> import and would have to be cut and pasted for all the schedule entries in all three sections.  But....</p>

<p>I went into each section and added the three fields to the schedule....and ta-da....the data was there and appeared.  Thus, the lesson here is that the export/import tool either needs to create user fields in the target site (Best Option) or we certainly need a KB entry to explain that the field names need to be added manually and the data will appear.</p>",,41943,SAK-112,Import does not create custom fields in Schedule,10007,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype,Bug,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

[SAK-73] Cascading permissions,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-73,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>There are some interaction/consistency problems with the permissions. I have tested these on resources and announcements, they may also apply in other places.</p>

<p>1) When 'Revise' is unchecked, and 'Delete' is checked, the user cannot revise or delete, which makes sense. However, there is no indication of this in the permissions screen, where delete should be grayed out in this case. The user can also still see the delete button in the page when their permissions are set this way, even though the permissions prevent them from actually deleting things. The ideal solution would be to hide the delete button in the interface ANY time the revise button is hidden, in addition to graying out the delete permission check box as described above. This would also solve the following problem.</p>

<p>2) In the case where 'Revise' is turned off but 'Delete' is turned on, there is different behavior in different tools. In Resources, it gives you an error and leaves you at the delete confirmation page. You then have to hit 'Cancel' to return to the regular Resources page. In Announcements, you get no error message, and you are automatically returned to the Announcements page, where the item you tried to delete is still visible. The Announcements page should act like the Resources page.</p>",Windows XP / Firefox,41922,SAK-73,Cascading permissions,10007,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype,Bug,10003,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/minor.svg,Minor,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>For Classes it should read: </p>

Any advice is appreciated.</p>",68718,557058:9cd19dd3-e6f4-4916-9e00-0b7ef570059c,"Wed, 23 Mar 2005 12:04:59 -0500","<p>

<p>The ""Assessment Organization"" section of Assessment Settings differs from the spec in a few places. </p>

<p>1) Linear Access to questions with NO return to previous pages. <br/>
Random access to questions from a Table of Contents. </p>

<p>--However, I like this format <b>better</b> than the one in the spec.  Briefer and clearer.  Instead of ""Random access"", though, could it say ""Choose questions in any order from a Table of Contents"" or something like that?</p>

<p>""Random Access"", to me, means random shuffle - the questions presented in a random non-chosen order.  </p>

<p>2) Numbering <br/>
 Continuous numbering between part. <br/>
 Restart numbering between part. </p>

<p>The spec says:<br/>
  Continuous numbering between sections<br/>
  Restart numbering for each section </p>

<p>The spec version is better here.  If you keep ""parts"", it should be ""parts"" plural in both places, and ""for each"" instead of ""between"". </p>

<p>Can you take a look at the Assessment Orgainzation? Like Margaret pointed out the description under Navigation is a bit lengthy (based on the mock up on 12/6).

<p>There's no way we have time to wait for Glenn.  Change the mockup to<br/>
list the groups and put checkboxes next to them &#8211; we don't need to<br/>
do the box thing.  Daisy, can you implement this?  Just list them<br/>
in two columns like we do the feedback choices, with the default being<br/>
one group named ""Everyone"" with the box checked.  Then create the<br/>
authorization for each checked group.  &lt;-- this has already been implemented as 2 check boxes: anonymous &amp; authenticated users - daisyf</p>

<p>1) <br/>
The mockup for assessment settings calls for a set of pulldown menus to set dates and times; the actual page has three blank fields. </p>

<p>2)<br/>
If you put non-valid entries (text, non-date numbers, multiple entries, etc) in any of those fields and save the settings, you get an exception (se attached).   After I tried this I got the same exception from any delivery date field change, until I deleted the assessment and started over.  Restarting the browser didn't help.</p>

<p>3)  What do the check boxes next to the three dates (delivery, due, retract) mean?  You can check the boxes without filling in the fields, but if you fill in the fields without checking the boxes you get the same exception.</p>

<p>Ideally, the checkbox should be automatically checked when a value is put in the field.</p>",WINXP IE 6.0,19670,SAK-35218,Assessment Settings:  Delivery Dates section problems,10007,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype,Bug,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>The following links are available on the header bar when viewing assessment questions:</p>

<p>Name User Id Role Date Score Student Response Comment </p>

<p>The spec doesn't say what they're supposed to do - sorting criteria?   Here's what they do right now on the only assessment with multiple submissions, #25 El Barc:</p>


<p>Comment -<br/>
reloads screen with smaller comment box, sorts by comment alphabetically</p>

<p>Student Response -   Reloads page, no change       </p>

<p>Score  -     Sorts by score, low to high   </p>

<p>Date   -    Sorts -but date field is invisible, so by what?         </p>

<p>Role   -   Resorts by some criteria (but all roles are ""student"")</p>

<p>UserID  - all names are ""admin""</p>

<p>Name        all names are Administrator    </p>


<p>On the other assessments with only 1 submission, all the links above just reload the page, with a smaller comment box in the case of the ""Comment"" link. <br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

   I also changed publishedSettings.jsp in ""Author"" to match the navigation rule of the table of contents in ""Assessment Taking"".<br/>
   Please double check. Be aware of that, you have to create a new assessment, set it to linear access or random access for Table of Contents. Then check this assessment in Assessment Taking. If Random access is selected, then ""Begin Assessment"" should bring you to the table of contents page. If none of these two selected in Author, the default one should be Linear.</p>

<p>Assessment: marith default template</p>


<p>Action:  Editing and saving a question, with the ""save a copy to pool"" button checked.</p>

<p>Expected behavior:   If you edit and save question X in the authoring section,  should the software give you the choice of either updating the question in its question pool, or creating a new question?</p>

<p>What should happen if you save the original question to pool M, but when you modify it you save the new version to pool Y?  Should the two copies stay linked, or should the second one be a new independent question?  Should the user be asked which one they want?</p>



<p>Testing:</p>

<p>Duplicate questions appear in the Question Pools list every time a question is edited and saved in the Edit Assessment screen.  The first time I tried to modify the duplicates in the QP section, I got a ""can't save item"" exception (see attached 1).   After restarting IE and trying again, the duplicates could be saved and viewed with no problem (I know there's already a problem with duplicates appearing in the question list).</p>

<p>Then I tried creating a question in the Edit Assessment screen, saving it to one pool, then modifying it and saving a copy to another pool.   When I edit either the first or the second copy over in QP and save the changes, I get a ""can't save item"" exception (see attached 2).
