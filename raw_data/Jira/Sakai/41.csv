<p>When a user clicked on the Excel spreadsheet, opened Excel and then clicked on the link to the Word document, they were brought to their My Workspace instead of to the Word document that the link represented.</p>

<p>However, if the user downloaded and saved the Excel spreadsheet to their local machine and then clicked on the Word document link, their browser then took them to the correct location in Resources and launched Word.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of recursion error that is occurring here?  Is this a Sakai behavior or a browser behavior?</p>

<p>I know hyperlinks within Excel sheets can get messed up when Excel sheets are ""opened"" rather than ""saved""... sounds like that's what's happening here. I think what happens is that Excel renames the files as it opens it (because the actual location of the file is in some temp directory) and this somehow corrupts hyperlinks within the spreadsheet.

<p>The reason we don't display selections when there is no data is so you don't have questions like the following. What's D in this scenario?<br/>
Which color is not in the German flag?<br/>
o A.  blue<br/>

o D.  </p>

<p>This goes with our general design rule of ""If there is no data to display, then corresponding labels should not be visible."" Soooooo, actually the Questions page in authoring is the offender. When no data has been put in for a selection in the Edit Question page, it should not show on the Questions page.</p>

<p>One exception to this rule and a need for validation is if A, B and D have data, but C doesn't.

<p>1/. If you just enter 2 answers (A,B) and leave all the others (C,D) blank with never fill C and D.  Then you will see in editAssisgment - question view is A,B,C,D with of course C,D are blank and in delivery you can see only A,B, not C, neither D<br/>
2/. If you enter 2 answer A,B and C, then remove answer in C, never answer D.  The editAssignement- question wiew only show ABCD but in student view show A,B and C empty (that should not be.  Why ?  see * below), not D.</p>

<p>Right now as the program in question view in editAssignment always show all choices( A,B,C,D) even some are empty while the  student view only show those are not empty.<br/>
Now, to explain * above: in WYSWYG, if you enter something it will create a &lt;P&gt; tag as some sort of paragrap defined.  So, if you never enter anything, it does not read anything, but if you enter something and remove like in 2/. above, then it still has something in it.  And as our program right now just check for empty string, which is not (as it contain &lt;P&gt;.  so it show C with nothing in it in delivery view.</p>

<p>I just checked version 2.1.0_005 and the issue of incorrectly drawing characters is better, but still not completely fixed; at least it did not take down Sakai. As the attached screen image will show, the Title of an assignment is mangled; for comparison, the title should be the same as is shown in the assignment body. </p>

<p>A separate, but related additional note: in another test, I have foreign characters in the title of a MS Word document I uploaded as an assignment attachment. When the title was stored in the database, the foreign characters were replaced by regular characters. That is, ""Fore<span class=""error"">&#91;accent grave&#93;</span>ign Do<span class=""error"">&#91;accent acute&#93;</span>cument.doc"" is in the database as ""Foregin Document.doc."" </p>

<p>What you saw,  FZre:ign Cha9ra9cte_r TeAst.txt, is a part of the resource id, not the file name. In Resources tool, we are using Sakai's escape mechanisms to form proper resource id depends on the uploaded file's file name. The resource id is internal to Sakai. If you go to ""Revise properties"", the file title should still remain as ""Føre¿ign Cha¿ra¿cte¿r Te¿st.txt"".</p>

<p>Yes, it is still a problem because the file that is downloaded from Resources by the browser is called ""ign Cha9ra9cte_r TeAst.doc"" instead of the original ""Føréign Chàràctêr Tëst.doc"". And I believe this is not a browser problem because we find ""ign Cha9ra9cte_r TeAst.doc"" in the database's XML field.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Jim</p>",142153,557058:3954e45f-26c2-4342-9a71-46f6349617a8,"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 09:20:33 -0500","<p>OK. I agree with you that this is a problem.</p>

The last part of final id is ""FZre:ign Cha9ra9cte_r TeAst.doc"", notice the ':' char inside, it should not be there if, according to escapeResourceName in Validator.java, 'e¿' or alike chars should be replaced by 'e' only, not by ""e:"".</p>

<p>When debugging through the code, I found the length of String ""Føre¿ign Cha¿ra¿cte¿r Te¿st.doc"" is 31, instead of 26, which means e¿ is considered as two characters, e and the accent sign. So the loop-and-replace mechanism in escapeResourceName will not work as expected.</p>

<p>The redundant ':' turns out to cause problem later on when the file is downloaded. Validator's getFileName() is called, which takes last characters in id till a \ or / or :. That's why we have the truncated ""ign Cha9ra9cte_r TeAst.doc"" when dowloaded. Of course, there are other escaping problems in the other characters...</p>

<p>It is out of my scope for now. I will assign the ticket to Jim. He is the expert on this.</p>

<p>My developer supplies this note: ""In addition to this, Firefox and Safari seem to submit the characters differently. E.g. Firefox submits one Unicode character é (U233), whereas Safari &amp; Opera send two chars: plain letter 'e' + U769 (just an apostrophe that combines with the previous character). Both are valid under Unicode spec, and source of grief for developers.</p>

<p>""When displaying a page, Firefox apparently doesn't know how to combine two chars (submitted by Safari) into a single accented char, and shows squares for accent chars.""</p>

<p>Hope that helps,</p>

<p>Jim</p>",58368,557058:9211a1fd-193f-4f51-a630-ab988381bd36,"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 14:54:24 -0500","<p>I believe that it doesn't matter whether we have a 26-character or 31-character sequence when we are creating the resource-id.  We could use any arbitrary sequence of characters for the resource id, as long as it is a valid id and it uniquely identifies the resource.  So if we have a ""correct"" method of morphing those characters into a valid id, it doesn't matter which one we start with.  We might get a 31-character id when the resource is uploaded with Safari, and if another copy of the same file is uploaded through Firefox, we'd get a different resource id.  But that's OK, because they would need to wind up with different resource-id's anyway. </p>

<p>It sounds like the remaining problem may be our handling of the colon (':'). I just created a folder named ""empty:folder"".  I then added an uploaded file to it named ""jim2.zip"".  The access servlet for that file is:</p>

<p>    	 <a href=""http://localhost:8080/access/content/group/X1/empty%3Afolder/jim2.zip"" class=""external-link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:8080/access/content/group/X1/empty%3Afolder/jim2.zip</a></p>

<p>Notice that the colon is escaped to ""%3A"".  That's happening when the access url is placed in the document, not when the folder is created.  But Zhen points out a problem with having ':' in a resource-id because some file systems may use ':' as a path delimiter (is that still true?).  So maybe we need to eliminate ':' if it occurs in a candidate for a resource id.  Would that solve the current problem?</p>",75220,557058:9211a1fd-193f-4f51-a630-ab988381bd36,"Wed, 14 Dec 2005 15:09:15 -0500",<p>Maybe the problem is that the resource-id is used as the filename when the resource is downloaded.

<p>1. Import a test with time set to 0:00 three times.<br/>
2. Go to the first test, confirm that time is still 0:00.<br/>
3. Go to test 2, and set time to 1:05.<br/>
4. Go to test 3. Time will show as 1:05.  Change time to 2:05. <br/>
5. Return to test 1. Time will show as 2:05. </p>

<p>Points: It will not override a time set by hand, and the 'overriding' of a blank time is not permanent.</p>

<p>6. Go to test 2 (time manually set in step 3). The time will show as 1:05, not 2:05.<br/>
7. Go back to test 1. The time will show as 1:05, not 2:05 as it did in step 5.</p>

<p>But the overriding of a blank time is not just an illusion:</p>

<p>8. Publish test 1 (currenty showing 1:05).<br/>
9. Go to the published test. Time will show as 1:05 (and cannot be edited).</p>

<p>If you publish again with the Timed Assessment checkmark on, and then take the test as a student, you will have a timed test of 1:05.</p>

<p>Interestingly, publishing seems to lock down the time:</p>

<p>10. Visit test 3 (time manually set to 2:05). Visit test 1; time will still be set at 1:05. </p>

<p>Also, the 'timed test' checkmark is clearing on timed tests when you visit a non timed test and then go to to a timed test.

[SAK-2997] Clarify sakai.properties file,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2997,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I struggled this past weekend to install Sakai and the reason ended up that I was using an incorrect version of the distributed sakai.properties file. It turns out there are three different versions of the sakai.properties file distributed in the source code:</p>

<p>1) in /docs/<br/>
2) in /demo/<br/>
3) in /kernel/componnent/src/conf/org/sakaiproject/config</p>

<p>The one in kernel... was actually outdated because it included the java.beep property (which is ""no longer used"" according to the ""Sakai Properties.doc"" document on November 7, 2005).</p>

<p>While I recognize this may be a pre-release issue, there are two different versions in the released version of 2.0.1 (in /demo and /docs).</p>

<p>Might I suggest a couple things: a) have a header comment on which version of Sakai a sakai.properties file refers to because properties change; b) keep only one document or make it clear in a header comment where the authoritative version exists; c) have a header comment refer to the excellent ""Sakai Propoerties.doc"" file.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

[SAK-2970] Rich client for testing,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2970,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Students tend to be more demanding about testing speed and functionality than just about any other part of a CMS.  It's no surprise this is the case because its easier to be more forgiving of technology when you aren't doing something that is potentially timed or high stakes.  This is a challenge for testing because the fallibility of the internet often creates situations where testing delivery is rendered sluggish....a student has to wait a couple of seconds while one answer is submitted and the next question is loaded.  To create a snappier interface, it would be good to use remote scripting (maybe Ajax?) which will allow question answers to be submitted asynchronously.  The next question can display to the student even if the network is bottlenecking and taking a little while for the answer to be submitted to the server.  There are complications and challenges here.  One wants to move to a richer client to create a little more independence from the current state of the network.  On the other hand, this independence has to be managed carefully so that if a lot of questions are answered that haven't yet been submitted successfully to the server there's a way of caching these so that they are submitted eventually and not lost.  Students will be well served if they can take a test for an hour without glitches even if the network is up and down.  But they won't be served well if at the end of that hour there work isn't eventually saved to the server.</p>","For broadest access, rich client should be built using current browser technology.",55110,SAK-2970,Rich client for testing,10012,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10315&avatarType=issuetype,Feature Request,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>1. Soft delete: The user no longer wants the page, and doesn't want it to appear in the index. But wiki-like, the page history should still be around, but the current revision could say ""(This page has been deleted)"" (or something). The revision history could still allow users with appropriate rights to revert to a previous version (or someone could create a new page with the same name).</p>

<p>2. Hard delete: Some content has been placed on a page that the wiki owner does not want, not even the revision history / older versions (e.g. something which is a copyright violation, libellous, offensive, etc.). The user can then choose a hard delete which also deletes history.</p>

<p>So the 'Delete page' option could have two choices: delete this page, including history, or delete this page (retaining history).</p>",,,,,,Development,customfield_10000,com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-development-integration-plugin:devsummarycf,Rank,0|1045kw:,customfield_10019,com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-lexo-rank,Sprint,customfield_10020,com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-sprint,[CHART] Date of First Response,"Thu, 26 Jan 2006 03:28:05 +0000",customfield_10024,com.atlassian.jira.ext.charting:firstresponsedate,[CHART] Time in Status,customfield_10025,com.atlassian.jira.ext.charting:timeinstatus,78346,557058:c56c1549-92b8-414e-8939-676c78a106d4,"Sat, 18 Mar 2006 02:41:14 -0500",<p>Surely a fix to no longer wanted pages appearing in the index is to use the 'pages linking to this page' to filter out null entries.</p>,,145500,70121:b46d6c86-5017-4c14-bc9a-2ffd40f3ba85,"Mon, 19 Jun 2006 11:03:04 -0400","<p>Our instructors are looking for a ""delete of last resort"" feature.

If Bad Student1 creates a page called Slam_Student2, and posts inappropriate content there, the content stays on the wiki even after Bad Student1 has been arrested.</p>

<p>Soft deletes are conveniences, but in some cases a hard delete is where the rubber meets the road.

<p>1.  Publish an assessment with the ""graders can see student's identities"" setting on. </p>

<p>2.  Create an account with a username, but no first name or last name field.</p>

<p>3. Take the assessment as that user and submit it for grading</p>

<p>4.  View the Total Scores for the assessment.  The user will be listed as ""Anonymous"", and you can click on that to get to the student scores page.</p>

<p>5.  View the Question Scores page for the assessment.  The user will not have any submission ID or name link at all - you can't get to student scores for that user.</p>

<p>PROCEDURES / RESULTS</p>

<p>Procedure 1: Added 11 announcements to course site<br/>
Result: Ordering worked well. The most recent announcement was at the top of the first list of 10, with the oldest announcement on the second ""list""</p>

<p>Procedure 2: Changed the title of the oldest announcement<br/>
Result: The edited announcement moved to the top of the first list of 10 (position1)</p>

<p>Procedure 3: Changed the title of the most recent announcement AND specified a beginning date that was a few days in the past<br/>
Result: The edited announcement moved to last place (position11)</p>

<p>CONCLUSION<br/>
For a newly added announcement, the default date sort captures the time of creation, and sorts accordingly.</p>

<p>If an announcement is edited in any way without specifying a beginning date, the default date sort captures the time of the edit (overriding the time of creation) and moves that announcement to the top of the list.</p>

I had created a worksite with the 004 instance that had basically all the Sakai tools (minus 2 tools).

Subject: Re: FYI</p>

<p>The situation the bug report refers to is anomalous. The original bug  <br/>
report described Section Info's inability to create sections. The  <br/>
problem, it turned, was not with Section Info, but with a broken  <br/>
Oracle QA instance. The course in which sections were failing had a  <br/>
link to T&amp;Q. The Oracle QA instance, however, did not build T&amp;Q  <br/>
properly, so it in effect did not exist as an available tool. My  <br/>
guess is that the link to T&amp;Q inside a course combined with that  <br/>
tool's overall absence from the QA instance produced the section  <br/>
creation failure.</p>

<p>In any case, there is no general problem with sites that have the SI  <br/>
tool but do not have T&amp;Q. Apologies if the language in my bug report  <br/>
description suggested this.</p>

[SAK-2924] Institutionally configurable student ID is needed,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2924,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Any application which displays enrollments to instructors needs to include some way for instructors to unambiguously distinguish students with the same names.</p>

<p>However, we've found that the preferred disambiguator differs from institution to institution. At some schools, it's an institutionally-defined email address; at others, it's a student ID number; at others, it's the Sakai username. It very often differs from the UID used by authentication systems.</p>

<p>For this reason, early in the Sakai 2.0 development cycle, we determined a need for the Sakai framework to provide LMS applications with a ""display ID"", obtained via the new Agent or EduPerson interface. What actually got plugged into that abstract field would have to be easily configurable system-wide by an institution, either in enterprise integration or by selecting an existing field. That field would then be shown as the student ""ID"" column by all tools in a standard way.</p>

<p>However, the move away from the legacy User services didn't happen for 2.0, 2.01, or 2.1, and the legacy User object doesn't support such a field.</p>

<p>As a result, tools such as the Gradebook and Section Info have to pick one of the existing statically defined properties of the legacy User, and no single pick will be acceptable to all institutions. To our knowledge, this lack of flexibility has already caused problems at U. Michigan, MIT, and Stockholm University, and it's a blocker for UC Berkeley production deployment.</p>

<p>Even if Sakai doesn't move away from the legacy User interface in 2.2, support for a configurable student ID needs to be added somehow.</p>",,59464,SAK-2924,Institutionally configurable student ID is needed,10012,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10315&avatarType=issuetype,Feature Request,10001,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/critical.svg,Critical,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>I thought I understood the requirement but when I set out to fix it, I<br/>
realized that I don't. Please read the ticket to refresh what this is<br/>
about. Proposed new mock up:</p>

<p>===================================<br/>
Can we have the assessment type editor have:<br/>
(checkbox) Can edit default value? (below)  &lt;-- (1)</p>

<p> (checkbox) Anonymous users<br/>
 (checkbox, checked) Site members</p>

<p>Then assessment settings would be:</p>

<p> (checkbox) Anonymous users<br/>
 (checkbox) &lt;Site Title&gt;<br/>
==================================</p>

<p>1.  the current mock up said we are releasing the assesment to EITHER<br/>
Anonymous Users OR &lt;Site Title&gt;. They are radio buttons not<br/>
checkboxes. Checkboxes means we can release to both parties. This<br/>
reversal of specification will take us back to the old problem: if<br/>
people login and use URL to access an assessment that is also relaesed<br/>
to anonymous users, do we log his answer as submitted by anonymous or<br/>
as an authenticated user. Different instructors are going to interpret<br/>
it differently so I really don't think we should go back.</p>

<p>2. if I do not check (1) but check Site Members. What does it mean?<br/>
I can't edit the Relaese To? Does that mean in order to edit Site<br/>
Members, I need to check (1) too?</p>

<p>3. Maybe we should just get rid of the choices in Release To in template</p>

<p>Can edit<br/>
 Anonymous users<br/>
  Site members</p>

<p>Then assessment settings would be:</p>

<p> (radio) Anonymous users<br/>

the ticket is about?</p>

<p>fixed according to this email and discussion in staff meeting</p>

<p>Hi Huong - Lydia and I talked about this one and I forgot to share the results of that conversation. (Sorry Daisy!) But I think I have a pretty simple solution. A little background: when we had talked at the staff meeting a couple weeks ago we'd talked about removing the ""Assessment Released to:"" section, but it looks like Daisy has just disabled it. </p>

<p>In my conversation with Lydia, we talked about the very real possibility of an ""Anonymous Survey"" question type where you would want to set the default Released To: to anonymous and not allow editing to (hide) that section in Settings. This means we should allow setting the default to anon the way it was in the mockup.</p>

<p>Now that I'm thinking more about this, there is a problem in hiding that whole section if it's anonymous because you still need the Published Assessment URL. This would mean we should probably not have the Can edit? question.</p>

<p>So can we do this in Assessment Types &gt;  Released To: </p>

<p>Released To: <br/>
(checkbox) Can edit default value (below)?<br/>
                 (radio) Anonymous<br/>

<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY<br/>
THIS AFFECTS HOW YOU INTERPRET TESTS OF THIS FIX<br/>
There are some issues in settings that can affect the correct function of this fix.  These should be treated as authoring settings page issues.<br/>
==================================<br/>
1. The backing bean retains last set duration from the previous assessment.  If you go to that section and save, it will set the duration to the duration of the previous assessment.  That is definitely a bug!<br/>
2. Unchecking the timed assessment does not zero out the assessment duration as it should.  This is sort of half a feature request and half a bug, but it causes problems.  I'll probably end up getting it assigned to me.<img class=""emoticon"" src=""/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png"" height=""16"" width=""16"" align=""absmiddle"" alt="""" border=""0""/><br/>
3. Notes in my source code indicate that (at least at one time) the setting that the assessment was timed was not reliable, therefore, the code relies on the time entered.  I will check that in the future, but I don't want to risk regression now.<br/>
4. If you accidentally leave the time in and turn off timed, you'll get that  spurious time in teh new assessment, and it wil interpret that as a timed assessment (see 1,2,3, above)<br/>
5. If you have a time in settings and it is not a timed assessment, you need to manually set the time to zero.  This is stupid of course, and we should document it, but it would be better to fix the bugs in 1 and 2, above.<br/>

[SAK-2909] Performance problems with background SQL queries in Oracle,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2909,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Certain SQL commands and settings were found to be major performance problems with CTools' Oracle.  These were:</p>
<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>validating the db connection with a simple SQL statement</li>
	<li>setting the default transaction isolation level</li>
</ul>


<p>(Note: doing a rollback after each connection use, and setting the auto-commit each time to the default value were also a problem and have been fixed already in the TRUNK)</p>

<p>Changes were put in CTools to address this, but the kernel db configuration was not structured to allow these changes to be applied to the TRUNK, so that the OOTB Sakai supports HSQLDB with these settings, and for Oracle, we can disable them as needed in the sakai.properties files.</p>

It may be possible to schedule refreshes of tool's title frame as well.  Or if this refers to the tool button not getting updated, maybe you'd need to schedule an update of the entire screen.

<p>1 - the wrapper class ""act"" is reserved for form button inputs, not for inputs used in navigation, it is used to contextually style inputs (as children of ""act"") if the institution wants to. </p>

[SAK-2873] Inconsistent use of Hide/Show across and within tools,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2873,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>When disclosure triangles are used with logical group headings to collapse / expand sections, the use of ""Hide/Show"" is inconsistent. For example Resources uses ""Hide other sites"" / ""Show other sites"", whereas when creating a resource, ""Optional properties"" doesn't include Hide/Show.</p>

<p>In Assignments, it's inconsistently used on the same page (see screenshot).</p>

<p>Usage should be consistent across and within tools. </p>

<p>My suggestion is to eliminate use of Hide/Show in these contexts, as:</p>

<p>1. The style guide does not indicate using Hide/Show.</p>

<p>2. In most instances, Hide/Show is not used.</p>

<p>3. The label is describing the contexts of the expanded/collapsed section.

<p>I just finished fixing non-ascii char suport in 1.0 (we have been running it in a pilot, but people liked it and entered real content, which they now want to retrieve). From what I found there were several places where translations didn't preserve non-ascii chars, but mostly in the vm files calling escapeHtml and escapeUrl methods; there were no real deep problems with char support beyond what was done at the user inteface level. Filenames were preserved, content also, only some problems showing up content in some user interfaces.</p>

<p>The behavior has been changing from sakai 002 to 006. I wonder if it is also a simple fix like the one for 1.0.</p>

<p>In the ShowFeedback screen for the model answer for SAQ, we are currently using an alert box to do it. There is a couple of problem.</p>

<p>1.  a character like ' and "" will ruin the alert box. I suspect that the problem that Maragaret has encountered is to do with soem hidden character. So I started writing String -&gt; unicode transformation. Then I realized 2.</p>

<p>2. the model answer is collected through the WYSIWYG which added a lot of HTML tag, the most common ones are &lt;P&gt; to keep the display on teh browser intact. Problem is when displaying in teh alert box with such sentence liek<br/>
""&lt;P&gt; this is the model answer:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; once upon a time ...&lt;/P&gt; you get a full view of all these HTML tags. </p>

<p>My conclusion is that I think we should just display teh model answer with &lt;h:outputText escape=false&gt; simply because the text carries teh answer as well as the display format and JSF can display the HTML tag for us correctly.</p>

<p>Marc: I am going to fix it this way first and reassign to you.</p>

<p>Lydia: I am checking in the unicode transformation to itemContentBean in case we want to use it later.</p>

<p>Looking at them, there seem to be at least two issues.</p>

<p>1) The average percentage is not being calculated correctly for this fractional external assessment. Also, although we're specified to show up to two decimal places for an assignment points value (truncating, not rounding), the external assessment (with total points possible ""10.6666"") is showing as ""10"" instead of ""10.66"". I suspect these two are related.</p>

<p>2) Tests &amp; Quizzes seems to be following a different rule for its score display. I assume that the graded student received a perfect score, which would be equivalent to ""10.6666"". But instead of truncating at two digits as the Gradebook is supposed to (""10.66""), T&amp;Q is rounding at one digit (""10.7""). If that's the case, we might want to try to negotiate a rule between us to cut down on user confusion.</p>",57893,557058:b049251e-0527-41d3-8805-b4e25be5390f,"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 06:49:32 -0500","<p>Well, the first problem is simple enough to explain. When we agreed on the Gradebook external service API with the Tests &amp; Quizzes team, we set the ""points"" argument for an external assessment to be an integer. I suspect this was some limitation at the time which has since been dropped.</p>

<p>I'll open a bug report on Tests &amp; Quizzes and link it to this one. Hopefully, we'll be able to coordinate a move to a floating point value before 2.1 final.</p>",74762,557058:b049251e-0527-41d3-8805-b4e25be5390f,"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 10:02:32 -0500","<p>The Gradebook and Tests &amp; Quizzes now communicate in floating-point point values rather than integers.</p>

[SAK-2833] Statistics view in grading breaks last/all submissions views,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2833,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>The statistics screen in grading has a ""Last Submission/All Submissions"" pulldown menu.  If you choose Last Submission, the stats view should only count the most recent submission from each site member.  If you choose All Submissions, it should count them all.</p>

<p>Here's what I did/steps to reproduce:</p>

<p>1) Add 5 students to site, in various sections:   A, B, C, D and F. </p>

<p>2) Took an assessment once as A, B and C each.</p>

<p>3) Took the assessment 4 times as F. </p>

<p>4) Didn't take the assessment at all as D. </p>

<p>5) In grading, viewed total scores page.  I switched back and forth between Last and All in the submissions menu, and everything looked good -  either 5 entries (including the no-submission one for D) or 8 showed up. </p>

<p>6) Went to statistics, which by default had Last Submission chosen.  The overall histogram showed 5 entries. (odd, given the no-submission.)</p>

<p>7) Chose All Submissions.  The number stayed at 5   That's not good.</p>

<p>8) Returned to the Total Scores page.  Now I saw only 5 entries when choosing All Submissions here too!  </p>

<p>9) Moreover, the user with no submission, D,  had his status changed to ""All Graded"" suddenly. (I need to do more checking into exactly when this happened.)</p>

<p>10).  If I choose Last Submission from the menu in Total Scores, let it refresh the page, and then choose All Submissions again, the missing entries will come back..   They vanish again whenever  visit the statistics page, though.</p>

<p>So something about the submissions menu on the stats page is screwing things up on the total scores page. I don't see any exceptions in the logs. </p>",WINXP IE,28903,SAK-2833,Statistics view in grading breaks last/all submissions views,10007,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype,Bug,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>This fix covers removing the introduced dependencies on sakai framework in scriptlets which are Samigo-standalone-incompatible.  These were put into numerous JSF pages to support Indiana's non-use of file upload questions.  For 2.1 I used dependency injection to create an integration dependent implementation of this code in AgentFacade.  I also added a 2.2 task to clean this up, as it is kludgy.</p>",,57926,6164e4a8198b4f0068d3681a,"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 11:52:11 -0500","<p>""Not standalone testable"", I mean.</p>",57980,557058:2a4a4fae-8ba7-4cba-9785-bd2564ab24e2,"Fri, 18 Nov 2005 07:57:57 -0500",<p>Reopening this to fix the extra %&gt;  in editAssessment.jsp page. </p>,125069,557058:2a4a4fae-8ba7-4cba-9785-bd2564ab24e2,"Fri, 18 Nov 2005 08:42:40 -0500","<p>Please include this for 2.1</p>

<p>Just one example of the sorts of problems you can run into if you do not do this.  In Samigo we have several rich text edits in the settings page inside of collapsable divisions. In Firefox (but not in IE) all of the editors willbe disabled and will not work.  This is one of the reasons that Samigo has its own version of the rich text editor, as we have an enormous kludge where every rich text editor is tracked in memory and reinitialized every time a division holding the editor is maximized.  </p>

<p>We don't want to get suprised when the editor ""appears to come up fine"", but will not pass QA, and becomes unsupportable in production.</p>

<p>I suggest that if we pursue this, we do it as an R&amp;D task with a software engineer paired with someone in QA and qualify the extension to  a new browser against the whole UI of Sakai.  We'd also need to qualify the extension tothe Samigo rich text and make sure it does not break the settings pages.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could add the new code with a comment and comment it out by default with a warning that it is not officially supported.  This could be done with a minimum of work, and somebody who experimentswith it can report back to the Sakai community.</p>

<p>It sounds like a lot of work, but whenever you integrate complex JavaScript you have to test browser compatibility carefully.</p>",149810,557058:d083b1a2-05d0-42f2-a6cc-6f872b5fa30f,"Thu, 6 Aug 2009 20:38:26 -0400",<p>Refers to HTMLArea which is no longer in use.</p>,,,,,,,,,,Development,customfield_10000,com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-development-integration-plugin:devsummarycf,Rank,0|103pqg:,customfield_10019,com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-lexo-rank,Sprint,customfield_10020,com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-sprint,[CHART] Date of First Response,"Wed, 16 Nov 2005 14:17:44 +0000",customfield_10024,com.atlassian.jira.ext.charting:firstresponsedate,[CHART] Time in Status,customfield_10025,com.atlassian.jira.ext.charting:timeinstatus,,,,,2.1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cloners (migrated),24494,SAK-2799,,,cloned as,10009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>My suggestion is that for now we change ""All Graded"" to ""Auto Graded"", and use that only for assessments that have been totally auto-scored.   For assessments with some manually graded questions we don't say anything.  </p>

At first glance, I originally thought the status ""All Graded"" means that this submitted assessment has been graded, no need to go through it again. Imagine if u are grading 100 studnets, it is useful to know that which students has been graded and which one has not.  Sometime, u can only grade half of the class and u want to know where u were when u get back. And the no_submission alos fit well in this column. </p>

<p>2. then Margaraet said that it is really meant to tell instructor that this is auto-graded by computer. OK, if that is the case, most of the time, given that everybody took the same assessment, this value of this field is going to be the same except when you are pulling different set of question from a pool. In otehr words, some studnet took an assessment that can be auto-graded by teh computer and some took one that have a file upload question. </p>

<p>Wow! that is a big problem for the developer now. 'cos it means we need to shift through each assessment, look at each questions and decide if this is ""auto-graded"" or ""need human attention"". Well, if we truely wnat this feature, I suggest that this should be found out and recorded when studnet is taking/submitting an assessment. IU is alraedy complain that totalScore page is slow, I can't afford to have another of these method to clog it up again. </p>

<p>The problem:  looking at itemGradingData record, there is no way to tell if a question is graded or not. </p>

<p>e.g. a MC question can be graded by computer but a SAQ need human attention. During a sucessful submisison, while the autoScore for these 2 questions were recorded as 5 and 0 respectively, the gradeBy and gradedDate remains as null.  </p>

<p>To be able to distinguish a graded question and a not graded question, we need to utilize these two fields: gradeBy and gradedDate. E.g. for the MC question, gradedBy=""computer and gradedDate=""SYSDATE"". These two fields should remain null for the SAQ question until someone actually assigns a score to it.</p>

<p>By the way, we need to make up our mind for the field ""autoscore"". Currently autoscore really means ""score"" not ""autoscore"". When instructor assigned a score to the SAQ question, it is recorded in ""autoscore"" not ""overridescore"".</p>

----------------------------------------</p>

<p>The default template was removed by design for Sakai 2.1.  We figured that <br/>
since all settings should be viewable/editable by default from now on,  it <br/>
would simplify things for instructors if the default template was <br/>
transparent.   An instructor should only need to deal with templates if she <br/>
or he wants to limit the available settings in created assessments.</p>

<p>Does that make sense? There shouldn't be any loss of functionality at all <br/>
(if there is for you, please let us know!);  the intent of this change just <br/>
to make the user experience less confusing.  Hopefully it won't have the <br/>
opposite effect. <img class=""emoticon"" src=""/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png"" height=""16"" width=""16"" align=""absmiddle"" alt="""" border=""0""/></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>This problem was noticed with CourseTools to CTools batch migration, so it's of interest to UM, but it may point to a problem that would afflict other schools that use the batch migration feature.""</p>

<p>The problem is related with some smart quote characters not decoded correctly. And it is an issue not only with Archive tool, but also to any tool which has base64 decode routine inside.</p>

	To: 	  sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I was trying to build Sakai (2.1.0_003) with the IMSEnt userdirectory<br/>
provider, but have had no luck. I presume one needs an entry like:</p>

<p>&lt;bean id=""org.sakaiproject.service.legacy.user.UserDirectoryProvider""</p>

<p>class=""org.sakaiproject.component.imsent.user.IMSEntUserDirectoryProvider""<br/>
init-method=""init""<br/>
destroy-method=""destroy""<br/>
singleton=""true""&gt;<br/>
&lt;/bean&gt;</p>

<p>in components xml (and the default commented out).  Does one need any<br/>
dependencies defined in project.xml (such as the Sakai SQL service)?</p>


<p>I'm interested in learning from the provider for a similar<br/>
coursemangement provider we will need to develop</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>David Horwitz</p>

<p>Tested the following (separately) on all 3 nightly instances:</p>

<p>1.  Created random draw part, followed by rd part using same pool</p>

<p>2. Created random draw part, followed by regular part with questions imported from same pool.</p>

<p>3. Imported questions from a pool to a part, then created a random draw part drawing from the same pool.</p>

<p>I was able to do all 3 of these on all instances, although after doing #1, previewing the assessment threw a nonfatal exception. (see attached).  </p>

<p>#1 should definitely not be allowed.  Possibly #2 and #3 should not be allowed either as they risk accidentally duplicating questions within an assessment.

The pulldown list should only show question pools not currently used by other random draw parts.  </p>

<p>One thing to watch out: When you copy a pool, for example , p1 to p1-copy.  you can only use one of them in random draw parts.  A long time ago, someone decided that when you copy a pool, the items in the pools are actually shared.  Only a new set of mappings are created.  You can think of it as creating an alias for a pool when you copy a pool.  I will have to ask Marc the rationale behind this.  Anyways, we need to document this.  Deleting items from a copied pool is fine, because it's the mapping that got deleted, not the item itself.  </p>",,108294,557058:2a4a4fae-8ba7-4cba-9785-bd2564ab24e2,"Wed, 16 Nov 2005 15:12:58 -0500","<p>One more note:  it's possible to filter out all the pools that have shared questions with those pools already used for random draw parts, but it's going to be an very expensive. Also I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do.  Users can copy p1  to p2 and then add another 10 questions in p2.  We shouldn't exclude p2 from the available pools just because it shares a few questions with p1.   Anyways, this needs to be revisited.  Let's ask Marc why copyPool  was designed this way and how people use it in real life.   </p>",175257,557058:2a4a4fae-8ba7-4cba-9785-bd2564ab24e2,"Mon, 21 Nov 2005 12:25:11 -0500","<p>To avoid confusion, the work around would be to never include 2 random draw parts in the same assessment.

<p>There still appears to be a problem in single correct, if the correct answer is greater than the  4th.  This was working originally, but with the new code that fixed everything else, that seems to be a problem. This is a little odd, as the single correct fix was nearly identical with the multiple correct fix, but I will investigate.</p>",41267,6164e4a8198b4f0068d3681a,"Thu, 1 Dec 2005 10:18:03 -0500","<p>OK.  I did some more testing with the current version.  </p>

<p>It turns out that I am seeing very complex behavior, always with answers after the first four.  However the problems do not show up on every possible combination, so it is actually possible to think that this probem is fixed or not to encounter it.  I note that five and greater answers require the user to select a non-default number of answers, so this might have less impact than we think.</p>

<p>This is a major ""go figure"", so I am wracking my brains on this.  Here goes:</p>

<p>1. MC SC with 6 answers with answer level, correct and incorrect feedback.  Set E correct.  Exports and imports correctly.</p>

<p>2. MC MC with 6 answers with ""A"","" E"", ""F"" correct and with answer level, correct and incorrect feedback.   Export and import lose the answer ""F"", but all else is normal.</p>

<p>3. MC SC with 6 answers with answer level, correct and incorrect feedback.  Set ""F"" correct.  Export and import lose the answer ""F"", but all else is normal.  Of course there is no correct answer now, but I mean the feedbacks and text are retained.</p>

<p>4. MC MC with 9 answers with ""A"","" E"", ""H"", ""I"" correct and with answer level, correct and incorrect feedback.    Export and import lose the answer ""H"", but all else is normal.</p>

<p>5. I may see a pattern here.  If we have a multiple correct with feedbacks and the correct selections are ""A"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H"", ""I"", ""J"" .  Export and import lose the alternate answers, and only ""A"", ""E"", ""G"", ""I"" are marked correct.  And--</p>

<p>6. If I do an identical question, but mark all correct, the correctness on the first four is preserved, but ALTERNATES on every other answer past the first four.</p>",175387,6164e4a8198b4f0068d3681a,"Fri, 2 Dec 2005 13:23:16 -0500","<p>FIX DETAILS<br/>
==========<br/>
I fixed import to correctly align correct answer feedback so it doesn't affect correct flagging, export to work independed of order in answer feedback<br/>
modules:<br/>
 component/src/java/org/sakaiproject/tool/assessment/qti/helper/item/<br/>

<p> app/xml/xsl/dataTransform/import/v1p2/<br/>
      extractItem.xsl<br/>
Fix revision 4414.</p>

<p>Testing notes:<br/>
This is primarily an export bug.  The answer feedback was misaligned and resulting in unflagging alternate correct answers beyound the first four (as described above).</p>

<p>In doing so this exposed an order dependency in import. I changed import to not care about the answer feedback relative position.  So to properly read post-4414 XML you will need to have a post-4414 server.</p>

<p>However, I also tried to make this backwardly compatible with earlier answer level feedback, such as found in the actual 2.1 release.</p>

<p>TESTING SUGGESTIONS<br/>
1. To test this fix, make both MCSC and MCMC questions, add at least two extra questions.<br/>
For the MCSC flag ""F"" (or ""H"",""J"", ""L"".... etc.) as correct and add all feedback.<br/>
For the MCMC flag all as correct.<br/>
Export/import</p>

<p>2. Also, if you have XML from the 2.1 release, run the same test.</p>

<p>3. Do at least one regression test vs a 2.1release build for all types.</p>

<p>4. You can make other combinations, but the only thing I was seeing pre-fix was alternate&gt;4 correctness, so test case 1 is aminimum.</p>",59860,6164e404c669a60069cbbb37,"Tue, 31 Jan 2006 12:16:20 -0500",<p>verified on  stable instances</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20672,SAK-2766.xml,41887,ug:1f7b7568-7013-4114-85a9-33f577fab6dd,"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 10:46:11 -0500",17379,SAK-2766_post-import.jpg,185462,ug:1f7b7568-7013-4114-85a9-33f577fab6dd,"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 10:44:04 -0500",14040,SAK-2766_pre-export.jpg,174896,ug:1f7b7568-7013-4114-85a9-33f577fab6dd,"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 10:43:54 -0500",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Relate,,,,,,10008,,,,,,24359,SAK-1872,is related to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>Could we have more details please?</p>

<p>If this is a recommendation - some markup (before and after) would be of great use.</p>

<p>The ""site navigation"" tabs already consist of an unordered list of items set to display inline. This should result in a single line display.</p>

<p>We might not get this done this turn around - it is the portal servlet that produces that markup - and am not sure how much work we can put into it at this point when it is quite likely it will be replaced soon with something more templatized that separates logic, content and presentation.</p>

<p>That said, may I offer an interim solution if you are willing to undo it after the root issue is resolved?</p>

<p>Give the unclassed &lt;li&gt; a negative hmargin: this will pull them together, then you can separate the contents via padding of the &lt;li&gt; or the margins of the contained &lt;a&gt; Some fudges and hacks in the portal sheet may need to be tinkered with.</p>

<p>Yes - I see it: &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" ?&gt;</p>

<p>Any node before the doctype declaration may bung up display in IE, I am afraid. This includes any node, comment, anythnig. They will shortcircuit the doctype declaration and throw IE into quirks mode, which means all rendering bets are off. And certain things, like the toolbar (because of the special margins), really depend on the browser operating on standards compliance mode.</p>

<p>Tests &amp; Quizzes (aka Samigo) still has the problem - in that case it is html comments before the prolog. Other tools may too (pi, comment or whitespace even).</p>

<p>Andrew - would you consider testing this - removing the PI and checking to see if that takes care of the issue? Many thanks, and sorry for the trouble.</p>

<p>Stephen - if there are toolbar issues with any other tool that you know of - can you check the source and see if any of the bits mentioned above are present? Many thanks.</p>

[SAK-2726] Email-archive tool should change the smtp return path for outgoing mail,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2726,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>The outgoing email service does not change the smtp envelope from address (return path) for outgoing mail.

<p>This is undesirable because the user sending the email message is emailing a group address, and has no control over the individual destination addresses.</p>

<p>The email service should have a config option to allow the return path address to be configured so that bounces go to a site owner (similar to mailing lists) or a globally defined bounce address rather than the original sender address.</p>

I sent an ""announcement"" on Sat 2/14/2009 1:49 AM from the above course website<br/>
I believe the ""priority"" was set to ""high"" (i.e. send to everyone on class roster).<br/>
However, I need proof of this. I do not see any way in CTools to verify, after it has been sent, if an announcement was sent with ""high"" (or ""low"") priority. Can you verify this for me for this particular announcement?<br/>
Is there a way to see this in CTools in the future? This can be very important if someone says they didn't receive an annoucnement . . . .</p>

there have only been 3 announcements from my ctools project site administrators, most recently Apr 6, but I've never gotten any of them, although I can see them in the 'announcement' section of the project site. I use GroupWise and just looked over my checked junk mail handling lists: ctools is NOT on my junk or block lists.

<p>Students just completed a mid-term exam that was made up of all essay questions.  The system provided a default grade of ""F"" in the Gradebook which panicked many of them as they thought they had all failed.  In other CMS the gradebook is ""aware"" that essays have to be graded by the instructor and post a comment to students indicating that grading is pending or something to that effect.</p>

<p>A temporary work around is to configure the exam, via the Test and Quizzes tool, to not provide student grades in the ""feedback"" and to not send grades to the Gradeboook.  This prevents students from seeing the default ""F"" that is initially assigned.  The only problem is that the ""feedback"" configuration settings in the test/quiz can only be set before it is published so once you turn ""off"" the grade feedback it will not be possible ot turn it back on once the test is taken.  This said, you can configure published test that initially did not share grades with the gradebook to do so even after the assessment is published.

I should have checked that before I added a comment. Anyway, when you<br/>
disable all feedback, the problem goes away, but the problem still exists<br/>
when you allow delayed feedback.  If you mark the question for review you<br/>
are still given the points earned per question.  I thought that delayed<br/>
feedback would give the student feedback on the date the user specified, but<br/>
I got feedback instantly.  I have attached screen shots of my template<br/>
settings and assessment settings.  I am probably doing something<br/>
wrong...knowing me!!  </p>

My attached file has more questions than in the original problem assessment, so that would be a very good test if you can grade it.  (The test itself is pretty stupid in that it is all 0 scores and nonsense, but it is big).</p>

<p>A couple of other notes.<br/>
1) the attached HTML file will not look like a screen shot because it doesn't have CSS.<br/>
2) the test was done on a developer machine, so ignore the .mine &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;, just a little artifact in my copy of a JSF file.</p>

<p>Also, if you are seeing the hangs in grading, does your build in production have the version of grading without the wysiwygs?  That was the recommendation of the latest 2.1 UI review and mockups,and should be the latest checked in version.</p>

In the same way that one can access Resources through WebDAV, it could be possible to access Wiki pages. These could have a URL like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://sakaisite/dav/wiki/siteid/"" class=""external-link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://sakaisite/dav/wiki/siteid/</a></p>

<p>with the folder containing a file for each wiki page as a .txt file corresponding to the wiki markup current version of each page (e.g. Home.txt).</p>

<p>The wiki/dav code would then handle versioning appropriately if the page was updated through WebDAV, the same way it would be versioned if updated through the Edit function in the wiki tool.</p>

<p>A Group will always give it's Site with the getContainingSite() call.  Now, this is never null.  Further, the site it gives is the site instance that the group instance is part of, so it is the right Site instance to pass into SiteService.save(Site s) to save changes to the group.</p>

<p>		SiteService.save(group.getContainingSite());</p>

<p>is a valid way to save the group.  You can initially get the group from a Site:</p>

<p>		site.getGroup(groupId)</p>

<p>or you can get the group directly from the SiteService given the group id or reference:</p>

<p>		SiteService.findGroup(groupIdOrRefString)</p>

<p>Either way, you can save it using the containing site.  The containing site is a full site object, so you can get the other groups, the main site membership, etc.</p>

<p>Note also that in 003 a bug in the site cache object is fixed; it used to leave the group object cached after a memory refresh (but it was nicely removed when the site entry expired in the cache).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Development,customfield_10000,com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-development-integration-plugin:devsummarycf,Rank,0|10530o:,customfield_10019,com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-lexo-rank,Sprint,customfield_10020,com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-sprint,[CHART] Time in Status,,customfield_10025,com.atlassian.jira.ext.charting:timeinstatus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[SAK-2663] Assessment created by TA of one section available to all student of that worksite,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2663,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>1.  As admin, created a worksite and added a T&amp;Q assessment and published it<br/>
2.  Had 3 different users access the worksite.  So now I have 3 users with ""access"" role in the worksite</p>

<p>OBSERVATION:</p>

<p>Could not assign TA role to any of the users because they were not listed in the TA section.  Had to change the role.  So,</p>


<p>3.  Changed one of the users to a ""maintain"" role<br/>
4.  In the ""Sections"" tool<br/>
    a.  Created 2 sections:  ""Discussion1"" and ""Lab1""<br/>
    b.  assigned one of the ""access"" user to the 2 sections, <br/>
    c.  assigned the other ""access"" user to the ""Lab1"" section only, <br/>
    d.  assigned the ""maintain"" user as TA for the ""Discussion1"" section only</p>

<p>5.  Logged in as the TA and created an assessment and published it</p>

<p>OBSERVATION:</p>

<p>The published assessment is visible to both ""access"" users, even though the TA is only the TA for the ""Discussion1"" section, and the second user is not a member of the ""Discussion1"" section.</p>


<p>ISSUE:<br/>
=====<br/>
In order to assign a TA to a section, the TA has to have a ""maintain"" role for the entire worksite.<br/>
Need a way to limit the TA's access.  HOW DOES USER2 KNOW THAT THE ASSESSMENT THAT WAS CREATED BY THE TA FOR THE ""DISCUSSION1"" SECTION IS NOT ONE THAT HE/SHE SHOULD TAKE, SINCE HE/SHE IS NOT IN THE ""DISCUSSION1"" SECTION?</p>

[SAK-2660] Improve central management of role / permission mappings,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2660,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Sakai relies on roles and memberships as a way to simplify administration of fine-grained permissions within a site. As I understand it, the current implementation of this (good) strategy uses a templating approach. A new site picks up a copy of a roles-to-permissions template and uses that local copy from then on.</p>

<p>Here are some scenarios:</p>

<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>A site relies on the original roles-to-permissions mapping without any changes. This is likely the most common use case by far. In such cases, a single centralized set of mappings would be more efficient and maintainable than dealing with hundreds of duplicates.</li>
</ul>


<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>A new version of a tool has new or changed permissions. These can be added to the central templates, but I don't know of an easy way to modify existing sites which use that tool. If there's some predictable connection between old permissions and new permissions, a patch might be written and run to update sites across the database. Otherwise, action has to be taken at each site separately.</li>
</ul>


<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>Installation-wide, a new role is needed or a role's permissions need to be changed. (E.g., a ""Concurrent Student"" role has been added, or the administration has decided that users in the ""TA"" role should no longer be allowed to view roster photos.) As far as I know, there's no easy way to update existing sites accordingly.</li>
</ul>


<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>The instructor or site owner needs to treat some user in a special way. For example, an enrolled student has been disruptive and needs discussion posting privileges turned off, or a visiting scholar needs to be able to post announcements relating to their stay. Because the local site's user permissions are controlled by (a local copy of the) role mapping, I think the only way to deal with these cases is to create an exceptional bogus role and then move the user into the role.</li>
</ul>


<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>The instructor or site owner needs to treat some institutionally-defined role in a special way. This is the use case theoretically optimized by the current approach. I don't know how common it is.</li>
</ul>


<p>In a future version, perhaps Sakai could move towards a centralized-plus-customizations model, in which a central set of role-permission mappings can be overridden by individual sites as needed.</p>",,24427,SAK-2660,Improve central management of role / permission mappings,10012,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10315&avatarType=issuetype,Feature Request,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>A.  Instructor selects the ""Students can sign up for sections"" option<br/>
    1.  The ""Join"" option becomes visible to the student for any sections relating to categories to which the student  is not currently a member.   The  student can then join one section of each category.  The  ""Join"" option for the other sections of that category  becomes unavailable once the student has joined a section.</p>

<p>B.  Instructor selects the ""Students can switch sections"" option<br/>
    1.  The ""Switch"" option becomes visible to the student for any sections relating to categories to which the student is currently a member.  The student can then switch from one section in a category to another section in the same category.  </p>

<p>C.  Both the ""Students can sign up for sections"" and the ""Students can switch sections"" options are selected<br/>
    1.  The student can ""Join"" a section of any category to which the student is not currently a member. <br/>
    2.  Once the student has joined a section, all other sections in that category now have a ""Switch"" option<br/>
    3.  The student can ""Switch"" between sections of the same category.</p>

<p>For clarification:  The categories are:  Lecture, Discussion, Lab, Studio, Recitation</p>

<p>This all seems reasonable to me.</p>

<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>Setting to 1 with FF/Win seems fine, however it produces some odd-looking results with tools (not enough bottom margin so they look a bit unbalanced).</li>
</ul>


<p>I'd suggest setting it to 10, which is a good compromise, and see if any problems come up in QA with other browser/OS combinations. In the long run I'm not sure if this is the appropriate mechanism to use for setting tool margins though - it seems like that should belong in tool css rather, with the fudge set to as low as possible (+1).</p>

<p>However, with +10 it still doesn't really address the web content issue, especially when a horizontal scrollbar is created, in which case there's still a gap between the bottom of the scrollbar and the tool bottom border. For the web content (iframe) tool only, I think the fudge should be +1 (as small as possible), but I'm not sure if that's possible to implement?</p>",40380,6164fa3fc7bea400699c7618,"Tue, 8 Nov 2005 06:26:45 -0500","<p>How about this:</p>

<p>set the fudge to 0, give portletBody a bottom margin of 1em, thereby increasing the height of the contained doc and evening things out a bit.</p>

<p>So in the tool.css </p>

<p>   -&gt; .portletBody</p>
{padding:.3em 2em 1em 2em}

<p>and in headscripts.js</p>

<p>   -&gt; var newHeight = height + 0;</p>

<p>this seems to do it overall.</p>",74398,557058:d083b1a2-05d0-42f2-a6cc-6f872b5fa30f,"Thu, 10 Nov 2005 00:33:33 -0500","<p>Results of experiments with 2.1.0.003 and the above:</p>

<p>In IE 6.0, height + 0 works OK.</p>

<p>In FF, you need at least height + 1 otherwise it puts a vertical scrollbar on web content tool and at least Syllabus, Section Info, Discussion, Announcements, possibly others (with the revised portletBody settings as above).</p>

<p>However, to eliminate the vertical scrollbar completely, the lowest I could get away with was height + 17. </p>

<p>The culprit here was Section Info - I'm assuming there's something odd about its rendering (possibly involving javascript), and that it could be fixed to not behave like this.</p>

<p>With height + 1, 1em as bottom padding still looks a bit too small in some tools, so I'd suggest 2em.</p>

<p>Overall recommendations:</p>

<p>1a. Fix the issue with Section Info tool, drop the headscript fudge factor 1, set portletBody bottom padding to 2em.</p>

<p>If that's not possible, then:</p>

<p>1b. drop the headscript fudge to 17.</p>

<p>2. Independently of the above, the web content / iframe tool (web content and related tools like worksite info that can use web content) should override the portletBody padding setting to set the bottom padding to 0. This leaves a 1px gap between the horizontal scrollbar (if created) and the bottom tool border, which looks ok.</p>",174679,6164fa3fc7bea400699c7618,"Thu, 10 Nov 2005 03:37:51 -0500","<p>This totally makes sense, Stephen.

<p>Now each ResourceBean ""docId"" property has to be equal to the file name of the ""location"" property.</p>

<p>This used to work and doesn't any more:</p>

<p>    &lt;bean id=""gradebookFeedbackOptions"" class=""org.sakaiproject.component.app.help.model.ResourceBean""&gt;<br/>

        &lt;/property&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/bean&gt;</p>

<p>Instead, this is needed:</p>

<p>    &lt;bean id=""gradebookFeedbackOptions"" class=""org.sakaiproject.component.app.help.model.ResourceBean""&gt;<br/>
        &lt;property name=""docId""&gt;<br/>

        &lt;/property&gt;<br/>
    &lt;/bean&gt;</p>

<p>I don't know  when this redundancy became required, but I'll send email to Lance and Glenn to suggest that the Help tool might be able to eliminate one of those properties rather than requiring both.</p>

<p>Also, it looks like the Gradebook is one of the only tools whose help files aren't managed as part of the central ""help"" module. (The other exceptions are ""profile"" and ""syllabus"".)

<p>I'm not sure I'm following the direction this is going  from this statement:</p>

<p> ""I think that we need a new security function (presence.view) - if the current logged in user has this in the site in question - they see presence - if not they do not see presence. This is a variation on the theme of buttons appearing or disappearing.""</p>

<p>Then again, I'm easily confused.  <img class=""emoticon"" src=""/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png"" height=""16"" width=""16"" align=""absmiddle"" alt="""" border=""0""/></p>

<p>The options discussed in this issue are basically about how the presence list can be shown or disabled. The original patch is to make it a site config option so that the Sakai administrator can disable it on a per-site basis for all users in that site (e.g. if you have a site that you know 1000 people are going to visit at the same time, you don't want them all showing up in the presence list, if only because it would make a very long list).</p>

<p>The permissions-based approach suggested is so that you can do it by role, e.g. faculty may see a presence list but not students.</p>

<p>So they're different use cases in a sense. Both need to be supported and they could be used together.</p>",146222,557058:d083b1a2-05d0-42f2-a6cc-6f872b5fa30f,"Mon, 15 Jan 2007 02:21:36 -0500","<p>Closing this issue as this particular implementation approach will not be used, leaving

<p>There are 2 UI difficulties here:</p>

<p>a. The presentation selection options are handled in 2 different ways (one in the page in a list box, the other from toolbar options).<br/>
b. The picture options are somewhat complicated. There are 2 toggles which suggest 4 possible states, but in fact only 3 are possible, viz. no pictures, official photo id, user picture.</p>

<p>A way to resolve this in favour of a consistent user experience would be to remove the toolbar options and add another list box below 'View', viz. 'Pictures' with options 'None', 'Official Photo ID', and 'User'</p>

 branch of authz tool for this. In r63684, I used one permissions.properties file in authz module, and put sample assignment permission description there. I think maintaining the descriptions in a central place would be easy.</p>

<p>However, I have also tried the other way: each tool itself would host a copy of permissions.properties file. When invoking the permission helper, the original tool would also need to pass in the permission descriptions as a HashMap object (I tried to just pass in the whole local ResourceLoader object, but always get ClassCastException). So that means changes in action files in each tool.</p>

<p>How do people think? If no one especially vote against the first approach (central file inside Authz module), I will merge the branch in and mark this issues as resolved....</p>",82912,557058:d083b1a2-05d0-42f2-a6cc-6f872b5fa30f,"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 09:18:09 -0400",<p>My vote would be to allow each tool to package its own permission descriptions rather than centralize them.</p>,49077,5b5115c9dc42b22bc590c803,"Tue, 16 Jun 2009 01:18:05 -0400","<p>My vote would be the same as Stephen.

. And put permission description inside assignment tool in r63792. Please follow the changes in that version in order to make other permission descriptions appear in Permission helper.</p>

<p>So there are two places need to be changed in each related application:</p>

<p>1) add the following into doPermissions() of the application file:</p>

<p>				ResourceLoader pRb = new ResourceLoader(""permissions"");<br/>
				HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; pRbValues = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();<br/>

				{
					String key = (String) iKeys.next();
					pRbValues.put(key, (String) pRb.get(key));
					
				}
<p>				state.setAttribute(""permissionDescriptions"",  pRbValues);</p>

<p>2) add permissions.properties file into resource bundle, with the syntax of ""desc-PERMISSION=PERMISSION_DESCRIPTION"" for each descriptions.</p>

<p>When you publish an assessment with delayed feedback and a student takes it before feedback is available, the student should not be able to see any of the feedback components either during delivery or when reviewing the assessment. </p>

).  But the student can still see their current score and deduce which questions they've answered correctly while taking the test. </p>

<p>Fix: Only the point value of each question/part/assessment should be visible in delivery.  The student's current score should not be visible unless feedback is currently available <b>and</b> the ""student's score"" feedback component box is also checked.</p>

<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<p>1) Publish an assessment with at least one autograded question (multiple choice, for example) and delayed feedback.</p>

<p>2) Take the assessment as a student.  Answer the questions, then look at the TOC.  Your current score will be displayed (for example, 10.0/10.0.)</p>

<p>3) Change your answer for one question, then look at the score in the TOC again.  It will have changed depending on whether you got the question right or wrong. </p>",WINXP,50792,SAK-2587,current score still visible in assessments with delayed feedback,10007,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype,Bug,10001,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/critical.svg,Critical,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Is there any content in the site you are trying to get to? If not, then the title is not clickable (and probably should be grayed out or the like); otherwise, I'm not having experiencing a problem accessing content from other sites by clicking on titles to navigate. </p>

<p>per Marc's request, we need to scale down the permission that TA has in Test &amp; Quizes. In 2.1.0.001, TA's permisison is the same as instructor. </p>

<p>quoted form Marc'e email<br/>
""People in the TA role are not supposed to be able to create/edit<br/>
assessments. If a TA needs to be able to do that, then they need to<br/>
be instructor role. This is just to have parity between GB and T&amp;Q<br/>

<p>Can you remove all the permissions that has been ganted to TA in !site.template.course except these:</p>

<p>Wait.... let me confirm it with Marc again and I will post them in the following comment <img class=""emoticon"" src=""/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png"" height=""16"" width=""16"" align=""absmiddle"" alt="""" border=""0""/></p>

&gt;&gt; Hi Zach,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I've noticed the same behaviour - I believe its something to do with <br/>
&gt;&gt; expired sessions. I seem to get it if:<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1) The browser has been left open (particularly if not left on /portal <br/>
&gt;&gt; and not logged in)<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2) If the server has been rebooted in the background<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; BTW I''m a Linux/firefox user so its not a mac only problem!<br/>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm using Firefox 1.5 on windows with Sakai 2.1 and notice this behaviour every <br/>
time the server has been restarted and the page in the browser is <em>not</em> reloaded <br/>
before logging in.</p>

<p>we always had this, since 1.0, and though it was due to lost sessions,<br/>
either timeouts or tomcat restarts. At least it happens to us when we<br/>
restart tomcat but did not logout before. It does not seem random.<br/>

[SAK-2541] student review broken in local oracle instance,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2541,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>This bug appears only on the local Stanford oracle instance (<a href=""http://coursework-s1:28080"" class=""external-link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://coursework-s1:28080</a>).   It's not on either of the other local instances or on the MIT instances.</p>

<p>When I click on the name of an assessment in the review list, as a student, I should see a review page which shows the questions, my answers, and whatever feedback and coments are appropriate. </p>

<p>Instead, on the local oracle instance, I see a generated preview of the assessment, with the warning bars above and below and the TOC and all.  Is the wrong servlet getting called? </p>

<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<p>1. Take a published assessment as a student. Answer the questions and submit it for grading.</p>

<p>2. As a student, look at the bottom of the assessment list to find the submitted assessment. Click on its title to review it. </p>

<p>3. You'll see a preview of the assessment, rather than a review. Compare this to the view you get when you review an assessment on the hsql or mysql instances. </p>",WINXP IE,24442,SAK-2541,student review broken in local oracle instance,10007,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype,Bug,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

"[SAK-2506] Accessibility--Enhance ""Refresh"" function (Stage-2)",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2506,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Refresh Change Request<br/>
Goal:  <br/>
¿	Allow screen reader users to successfully use Sakai (refresh bumps screen reader to the beginning of the page every 10 seconds)<br/>
¿	Get rid of annoying click and page redraw every 10 seconds<br/>
¿	Keep current dynamic update functionality</p>

<p>Stage 1<br/>
Implement refresh in a way that the browser doesn't click or repaint the screen with each refresh.  The screen will only be repainted when there has been a change in the active tool.  This likely utilizes JavaScript and XmlHttpsRequest technology.</p>

<p>Refresh control will still need to be user controlled for this stage since, however infrequent, refresh will disrupt the AT user.  If stage 2 does not make the 2.0 release plan, we should look at improving the flow for this control.  A potential solution is to (display a hidden for sighted users) message or link on the first page users hit upon log-in to take them to the page where the control exists. </p>

<p>Stage 2<br/>
Implement ""you've got mail"" type functionality that will display a message to users that let's them know something has changed in their active tool (or maybe in the site in general) and allows them to choose to see those updates.  Screen reader users will likely have some sort of sound alert.  We'll potentially give the users a digest of what's new.  TTools team will design in the legacy tools refactor project.</p>

<p>1. Set the timeout interval in sakai.properties to something short, e.g. 180s:</p>

<p>inactiveInterval@org.sakaiproject.api.kernel.session.SessionManager=180</p>

<p>2. Start a long-running web services script, e.g. this perl script which creates new sites:</p>

<p>There are 2 related issues regarding permissions for the new Wiki tool:</p>

<p>1) The following message displays when the Wiki tool is clicked when logged in as admin.  The same message displays for both Course &amp; Project sites.  The links for default_template are not operational because the template is not available in Realms.  Message:</p>

<p>Default_template<br/>

The page you just accessed does not exist, and so has been created for you. You may now edit this page to change its content <br/>
Default Template<br/>
This page default_template is used as a template for new pages. You may: <br/>
Change it on a worksite basis by editing default_template <br/>
Change it on a installation wide basis by changing DefaultPage.txt referenced in components.xml</p>

<p>2) The same message as above displays when the Wiki tool is clicked for a Project site when logged in as maintain non-admin user.  However, when logged in as Instructor for Course site the following message displays:</p>

Although this is confusing, I think this is working correctly, unless there is annother error message that isnt in the report. I will try and explain.<br/>
There is a page ""default_template"" that is used to populate pages that dont exist.  This page, wihch is configured in components.xml (as the page says) contains the words ""Page Does Not Exits"". So on the Home page for the first time. You see the Home page, newly populated with the defualt_template. Which contains links to ""default_template"" itself. You will notice that the links dont have a ? at the end. Click on the link you get to the ""default_template"" page.</p>

<p>If you edit the ""default_template"" page, save it, go back to the Home page, Edit it, (add a new link eg <span class=""error"">&#91;Page2&#93;</span>), save it, click on the Page2? link, you will see a copy of the ""default_template"" page.</p>

<p>Does that make sense ? If there was an additional error, or it does not, please say.</p>

<p>Issue 2</p>


<p>None of the rwiki.permissions are set in the !group.template !group.template.course (and possibly other realms) So there is no permissions to read the page. This should have been set by the realm sql script.</p>

<p>Issue 1.<br/>
The message you are looking at <b>is</b> the the Home page, populted by 'default_template', everything is working correctly. Perhapse there should be a Home page to remove this confusion. I have attached some screen shots, to clarify this.</p>

<p>I created a new worksite as a registered user and went to the tool and got screen shot 1, you will notice that the text of the page says that the page did not exist and so has been <b>created</b> for you and you may now <b>edit</b> the page to change its content.</p>

<p>In the second paragraph it tells you that the page 'default_template' was used to create the page, and you can also edit 'default_template' if you want to...... or reconfigure 'default_template' on the server (components.xml, DefaultsPage.txt etc, etc).</p>

<p>You will notive that the Breadcrumb trail ends with 'Home' indicating that this is the Home page.</p>

<p>Screen shot 2<br/>
I've clicked on 'default_template'</p>

<p>The page title is now 'Default_template',  the breadcrumb train ends with 'Default_template' to this <b>is</b> the default template. </p>

<p>If you edit this page, you will find that all new pages in this worksite will use this page as a template.</p>

<p>Screen shot 3<br/>
I've edited the default template</p>

<p>Screen shot 4<br/>
I've added a new page link to the Home page, notice the ? at the end of the NewPage1 link indicating it does not exist.</p>

<p>Screen Shot5<br/>
Clicked on the NewPage1 link. New Page 1 has just been populated with the modified Default_template content, notice the edit, that I made in Screen shot 3</p>

<p>I'm not sure truncating short text fields in this way &#8211; when the fields are used for this specific type of meeting place context &#8211; is a good approach.  The first part of a typical ""address"" or ""location"" string is almost always unique, like the street number or room number.  The next part is generally unique as well, the first part of the name of the street or first part of the name of the building.  The last part of the name, however, is generally not unique; for example, Street/Avenue/Road/Parkway or Building/Hall/Center/Lirbary/Annex.  So, if you are giving up half of the 12 spaces to the last part of location, then you may can run into non-distinguishable strings very easily.  For instance &#8211; and I'm just guessing at the logic of how space or word breaks are handled here because I can't get to a running Sakai 2.1 at the moement &#8211; ""4234B LSA Admin Annex"" might become ""4234B ... Annex"", which doesn't really do much to differentiate it from ""1200A Museum Annex"" becoming ""1200A ... Annex"".  Which ""Annex"" is the section in?  </p>

<p>Or, my personal favourite, ""2074 Fleming Administration Building"" (our President's office), which would become ""2074 F...uilding"", to be confused with ""2074 Frieze Building"" as ""2074 F...uilding"" (a classroom I used to teach in) <img class=""emoticon"" src=""/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png"" height=""16"" width=""16"" align=""absmiddle"" alt="""" border=""0""/></p>",190411,557058:4dbec9fe-29d4-4702-8ad0-6a9ad0e17d56,"Fri, 28 Oct 2005 13:21:00 -0400","<p>The idea is to allow for ""Smith Lecture Hall #3"", where the #3 is very important.

[SAK-2444] Create special icon for very large collections,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2444,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Folder icons are used in the list view of the resources tool to indicate the following:  </p>

<ul>
	<li>an empty folder</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>an unexpanded folder that is not empty</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>an expanded folder that is not empty</li>
</ul>


<p>Another icon should be added to indicate a folder that is too large to expand.  This icon should be used for resource collections with more than a few hundred members (actual number to be determined).  The user's ability to expand such folders should be disabled, and that should be replaced with the ability to navigate to a paged view of the collection.</p>

<p>Until that is implemented, let's replace the ""expand"" icon with a new icon indicating the collection is too large to expand.  We will also disable the expand icon but let users navigate to the collection.  And if the user clicks ""expand all"", very large collections should not be expanded.</p>

<p>We could support pagination as described (or paging by accounts rather than by rows in the table) for drop boxes.  Search in the drop box UI by user would work with additional work in CHS or filtering at the tool level. But there is not an efficient way in the current CHS to do search by title in a large collection like this.

<p>Quoting Stephen Marquard &lt;marquard@ched.uct.ac.za&gt;:</p>

<p>% It still worked for me with a test of around 12,000 sites<br/>
% (with Admin a member of all of them), but it's slower than<br/>
% it needs to be.</p>

<p>One thing I have been pondering is the ability to access ""unused""<br/>
sites (say, a course from a previous semester) through an ""other<br/>
sites"" tool. We use something like this in our current CMS.</p>

<p>I could imagine flexibility in this: it could be enforced systemwide<br/>
and/or you could pick and choose what goes in the tabs and what goes<br/>
in this site. It's a bit more complicated than the current ""choose<br/>
what's in your tabs"" preferences. And it would reduce that clutter.</p>

<p>I'll dump this idea into JIRA.</p>

[SAK-2431] Apply the Rutgers Performance Fixes for MySql,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2431,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Take Rutgers MySql Patches from <a href=""http://rulink.rutgers.edu/sakai/"" class=""external-link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://rulink.rutgers.edu/sakai/</a> and apply.</p>

<p>We're not completed yet. We started out with 20 active users taking 90% of our 2-processor Netra for the MySQL process. We got it down to 5-25% by using the appropriate /etc/my.cnf. Now we're starting the hard part: optimizing the queries. The changes shown here have been done by running mysql with ""-log-slow-queries=/tmp/sqllog --log-queries-not-using-indexes"". I've been attacking the non-indexed queries.</p>

<p>While we haven't yet tried the results under a real load, we have verified that the most bothersome queries take .25 sec on our pilot system, and they're fairly common. Our production configuration will have 20 - 100 times the number of users, and these queries will probably scale as number of users (actually number of realms). So we clearly wouldn't be able to survive these in production. The optimized version takes &lt; 0.01 sec on the pilot system. On a build system I've gone through many of the common paths through the system to make sure that none of these maximally problematical queries are generated. However I'm sure that are other problematical ones I haven't found yet.</p>

Changes:</p>

<p>Aug 8, 2005. New DbRealmService.java. Fixes SQL syntax. The syntax normally worked, but would fail if run with prepared statement caching on.</p>

<p>WARNING: I have made no attempt to check which DB is in use and issue different SQL. This code is for MySQL. This version of DbRealmService may not even work with Oracle, much less perform well.</p>",,24398,SAK-2431,Apply the Rutgers Performance Fixes for MySql,10017,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10318&avatarType=issuetype,Task,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>From: Brokamp, Kevin M <br/>
Sent: Thursday, October 27, 2005 11:20 AM<br/>
Subject: User Renames</p>


<p>Here is how we currently handle renames-</p>

<p>1.  We receive an incident from ITPO.  Oncourse is usually the last stop on<br/>
the rename train so all of the other accounts (ADS etc.) have already been<br/>
renamed.</p>

<p>2.  We run the following query which tells us if the user has ever logged<br/>
into CL-</p>

<p>select title from sakai_site where site_id like '%username'</p>

<p>3.  If they haven't logged in (query returns with a value of 0), we get in<br/>
and rename them on the classic side.  If they have logged in (query returns<br/>
with a value of 1), we run the following queries to check and see if they<br/>
have any items in 'My Workspace' resources-</p>

<p>!--Lists files in My Workspace resources<br/>
select  * from content_resource where IN_COLLECTION like<br/>
'%/user/kmbrokam/%'</p>

<p>!--Provides information on folders located in My Workspace resources<br/>
select * from content_collection where collection_id like<br/>
'%username%'</p>

<p>4.  If they don't have any items in resources, we proceed by renaming them<br/>
in original Oncourse.  If they do have items in resources, we rename them in<br/>
original Oncourse, create a local Sakai account under their old username,<br/>
log in under that account and pull down the resource items manually.  We<br/>
then create a local Sakai account under their new username and upload the<br/>
resource items to that account.  After this is complete, we delete both of<br/>
the local Sakai accounts and use the 'Become User' tool to make sure the<br/>
resources are appearing under their new username.  </p>

<p>There are some concerns with this process as it does not address how the<br/>
student shows up under the gradebook (and I'm sure there are other things<br/>
that probably need to get updated on the backend), but this is the process<br/>
that's currently in place.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>

[SAK-2361] Can't create sections,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2361,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Tested on the nightly oracle and mysql instances at Stanford <br/>
( oracle = <a href=""http://coursework-s1.stanford.edu:28080/portal"" class=""external-link"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://coursework-s1.stanford.edu:28080/portal</a> )<br/>

<p>Creating/viewing sections throws an exception on both these nightly instances, although the behavior is significantly different on each one. </p>

<p>I'll test the nightly2.sakaiproject.org instance next and report. </p>

<p>Steps on mysql instance: </p>

<p>1. Log in as marith/marith</p>

<p>2. Go to ""project test site"" &gt;  Section Info tool</p>

<p>3. See overview page, and the ""There are no sections"" message.</p>

<p>4. Click on ""Add Sections"" and choose Lecture type from the menu.</p>

<p>5. Fill in all fields and click add button to create section.</p>

<p>6.  Exception (see attached file 10.26.view-section):</p>

<p>org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: Hibernate operation: null,  message from server: ""Duplicate entry '' for key 2""; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: null,  message from server: ""Duplicate entry '' for key 2""</p>


<p>------------------------------</p>

<p>Steps taken on nightly oracle instance:</p>

<p>1.  Log in as marith/marith</p>

<p>2. Go to project site ""marith oracle"" &gt; Section Info tool.</p>

<p>3. See overview page and message that there are no sections yet.</p>

<p>4. Click Add Sections and choose to add 1 lecture section.</p>

<p>5. Fill in all fields and click add button to create section.</p>

<p>6. I'm returned to the Overview screen.  There's a message with a green checkbox saying the section was created successfully, but I don't see it - there are still no sections listed.</p>

<p>7. Click on Add Sections again and choose to add 2 discussion sections.</p>

<p>8. Fill in all fields, again, and click Add.</p>

<p>9. I'm returned to the Overview screen again with the same success message saying the 2 discussion sections have been created.  Now I see an entry for section ""discussion1"" on the overview page, with the appropriate links.  But there's still no sign of the lecture section or the other discussion section.</p>

<p>10.  Go to My Workspace and then back to the Section Info tool, to see if that refreshes/updates the list.</p>

<p>11. boom!  Exception (see attached 10.26.view-sectioninfo):</p>

<p>On the MIT mysql instance, I can go through the process of creating multiple sections and access the section info tool without causing an exception. However, only the first section I create is actually created. Adding more gets me a success message, but no actual new sections.</p>

<p>(I presume they're not being created at all, rather than just invisible, because I can create a section called ""lecture2"" 5 times in a row.  Hopefully the tool would complain about duplicate names if the sections were actually there.)</p>

<p>On the MIT hsql instance, I can create sections with no problem, and they do actually get created and show up in the overview.  </p>

<p>Can't test the MIT oracle instance right now because its down.</p>

specify whether it should attach links to the resources themselves or to make a<br/>
copy of the resource in the hidden attachments area and link to the copy.  For<br/>
now, all legacy tools will attach links to copies, and the OSPi tools will make<br/>
links to the resources themselves.</p>

<p>Typically in a legacy tool, state attributes are set as follows when launching<br/>
the file-picker.  This set of attributes will result in attachments being saved<br/>
as copies in the hidden attachments area:</p>

<p>state.setAttribute(ResourcesAction.STATE_MODE, ResourcesAction.MODE_HELPER);<br/>

<p>In the OSPi tools, you can get links to the existing resources rather than to<br/>
copies by setting the following attribute:</p>

<p>state.setAttribute(ResourcesAction.STATE_ATTACH_LINKS, Boolean.TRUE.toString());</p>

<p>Note that the value of that attribute doesn't matter.  If that attribute is set<br/>
with any non-null value, that mode will be selected.</p>

<p>As we discussed, all of this will change soon after the 2.1 release.  At that<br/>
point, we will be able to link to existing resources no matter where they are<br/>
and override the permissions to make them available to any set of users.  We<br/>
will revise the UI of the file picker at that point to surface more<br/>

The text which describes the asterix <img class=""emoticon"" src=""/images/icons/emoticons/star_yellow.png"" height=""16"" width=""16"" align=""absmiddle"" alt="""" border=""0""/> character has a typo. It should say ""A * means required information"". We could improve the accessibility of the '<b>' characters by adding a title to each SPAN element that surrounds the '</b>' character.

<p>Several requirements:</p>

<p>1 - printing should print the contents of a specific tool<br/>
2 - it should be a one click operation<br/>
3 - it should send to the printer a printer-friendly rendition</p>

<p>Some possibilities</p>

<p>1 - Simple</p>

<p>A  &lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""window.print()""&gt;Print&lt;/a&gt; that gets rendered in toolbar. This puts the focus on the iframed tool and sends it to the printer. This will work in most tools whose content consists of only one iframe. Others will need more work (Chat, Discussion, etc.). </p>

<p>The print styling will be applied at the printer and the user will not see that print version till she picks it up in the tray. This works in all browsers. Some IE5.5 issues that need to be addressed (problems with the @media type applying to other media than the one specified  - for example: hiding from screen things meant to be hidden from print)</p>

<p>In this case the print and screen css will live in the same file - the css links are</p>

<p>&lt;link href=""/library/skin/tool_base.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" media=""all"" /&gt;<br/>
&lt;link href=""/library/skin/ctools-mod/tool.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" media=""all"" /&gt;</p>


<p>2 - Two step</p>

<p>An   &lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""customPrintFunction()""&gt;Print version&lt;/a&gt; that pops the contents of the iframed tool in a new window with the css link targetting the print version - the new window has a ""Print"" link as above.</p>

<p>&lt;link href=""/library/skin/print.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"" media=""all"" /&gt;</p>

<p>Cons: </p>
<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>2 clicks</li>
	<li>one more stylesheet to keep track of.<br/>
Pros:</li>
	<li>user gets a preview of what things will look like</li>
	<li>since some tools will need an intermidiary rearrangement that <b>will</b> involve 2 steps anyways this will provide consistency.</li>
</ul>",177638,6164fa3fc7bea400699c7618,"Tue, 14 Feb 2006 09:23:27 -0500","<p>OK - regardless of the flow chosen above - what characteristics would such a printable version have? Asterics indicate ""probably yes"", Question marks ""not sure""</p>

<p>1 - omit from printed output</p>

<ul>
	<li>navigation and action elements (inputs and links) in views devoted to content</li>

Java's never been very bright about this stuff, and JSF just builds on that.</p>

<p>1) At first the Gradebook just displayed the scores ""as entered"", since the application restricts entered scores to two decimal places.</p>

<p>2) However, we have no control over the scores coming in from Samigo. The specification says that score displays have to be rounded down to two digits no matter how close they are to the integer line. To fix the display problems we were having, I now convert the stored scores to a high-precision form and truncate.</p>

<p>3) Scores were specified to be regular floating point numbers (as opposed to exactly-two-decimal-places pseudo-currency or to integers divided by 100). Computer storage of normal floating point numbers isn't exact.</p>

<p>Result: You say ""17.99"" but the floating point number stored in the database is actually (viewed at a high enough precision) equivalent to, say, ""17.989999999999998436805981327779591083526611328125"" &#8211; which we now truncate to ""17.98"". Similarly, multiplying ""17.99"" by 100 and dividing by 100 will give us something which truncates as ""17.98"". Searching the converted output string for a decimal and then truncating the string makes too many assumptions about internationalization.</p>

<p>Two options that come to mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Decide on some arbitrary decimal position at which rounding <em>will</em> occur (5 or 6?), and then truncating the result.</li>
	<li>Try to produce a DecimalFormat class that provides rounding down capability.</li>
</ul>


<p>The formatting classes are pretty hairy, and so the second option would take a lot longer, worthwhile though the effort might be.</p>",173974,557058:b049251e-0527-41d3-8805-b4e25be5390f,"Tue, 1 Nov 2005 07:24:07 -0500",<p>The Gradebook now rounds numbers at 5 decimal places before truncating them at 2 decimal places.

Please read carefully, as the old way is no longer supported.</p>

<p>The old way was to edit the single file:</p>

<p>legacy/component/src/config/registration.xml</p>

<p>and add your application's security functions.</p>

<p>Actually, the older way (Sakai 1.5, I  believe) was better; you could register your security functions with your tool registration.  That was removed in 2.0.</p>

<p>The new way is to have your application register your security functions.  This is best done in a manager or service, i.e. a singleton that starts up at server startup and contains your applications storage and business logic.  This is loaded by our component manager, and can be designated as having an init() method to call on startup.</p>

<p>The best place to define your security functions is in your manager API.  The really really best place to enforce security in in your manager API's implementation component.  It's in there, in the init() method, that you can register your functions.</p>

<p>The Sakai kernel now has a FunctionManager.  You can inject this or call it's cover.  The examples below use the cover:</p>

<p>import org.sakaiproject.api.kernel.function.cover.FunctionManager;</p>


<p>In your manager's init() method:</p>

<p>    /**</p>
<ul>
	<li>Final initialization, once all dependencies are set.<br/>
     */<br/>
    public void init()<br/>
    {</li>
</ul>



<p>simply call the registerFunction() method, like this (from content hosting):</p>

<p>            // register functions<br/>
            FunctionManager.registerFunction(EVENT_RESOURCE_ADD);<br/>
            FunctionManager.registerFunction(EVENT_RESOURCE_READ);<br/>
            FunctionManager.registerFunction(EVENT_RESOURCE_WRITE);<br/>
            FunctionManager.registerFunction(EVENT_RESOURCE_REMOVE);<br/>
            FunctionManager.registerFunction(""dropbox.own"");</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>See how there are nice constance defined in the ContentHosting API (all except for that dropbox.own) that makes it just the right place to make the registration.</p>

<p>Registration is transient - there's not database behind it.  The set of applications that you start up with your Sakai determines what functions are registered, each time you start.</p>

<p>There is another, less preferable way, to register an application's functions.  This would be good when integrating some external application, or when you have built an application that does not follow the Sakai method of separating persistence and business logic into a separate singleton manager or service.  If there is no convinient singleton from which to call registerFunction(), you can (once again) register the function in the tool registration .xml file.  This is a return of the feature we had in Sakai 1.5.</p>

<p>Alongside of the &lt;tool&gt; elements in a tool.xml file, simply add some &lt;function&gt; ones:</p>

<p>...<br/>
    &lt;/tool&gt;</p>

<p>    &lt;function name=""news.test"" /&gt;<br/>
    &lt;function name=""news.other"" /&gt;<br/>
...</p>

<p>(this is from a bogus example, since the Sakai code will not be using this feature).</p>

<p>Either way works.</p>

<p>The dependency for Maven, to include in your project.xml, for code using the function manager, is:</p>

<p>        &lt;dependency&gt;<br/>
            &lt;groupId&gt;sakaiproject&lt;/groupId&gt;<br/>
            &lt;artifactId&gt;sakai-function&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br/>
            &lt;version&gt;$</p>
{sakai.version}
<p>&lt;/version&gt;<br/>
        &lt;/dependency&gt;</p>

<p>Functions so registered are really only used (for now) in the admin ""realm"" (now called the authorization group) editor, and in the permissions helper tool that runs the permissions mode of many Sakai tools.  This list is the list that forms the lists of functions we present to the end user.</p>

<p>In the future, this area will be further extended, to get more interesting information associated with each function, so end users can have a better idea about what they are picking when they assign a function permissio</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Development,customfield_10000,com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-development-integration-plugin:devsummarycf,Rank,0|1051vs:,customfield_10019,com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-lexo-rank,Sprint,customfield_10020,com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-sprint,[CHART] Time in Status,,customfield_10025,com.atlassian.jira.ext.charting:timeinstatus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<p>Expected behavior:  To create a new template, you type its name on the main templates page and click the create button. This takes you to the template settings page, where the template title field is already filled in with the name you chose.</p>

[SAK-2310] File picker should make sure attachments have right permissions,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2310,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>In the filepicker, we show other sites with the idea that the user may want to choose a file in another site to attach an item to something in the current site.  The problem is that in the new file-picker, the user can do that by clicking the ""select"" action link for an item in the other site.  The user can complete the attachment, but it may not be visible to any other users in that site.</p>

<p>I can think of a couple possible approaches to solving this problem:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If user picks an item in another site, next step is to ask the user<br/>
    to select a place in the current site to paste the attachment.  Maybe<br/>
    the action-links in other sites should be ""Copy"" instead of ""Select"".</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Automatically make a copy of the selected item in a hidden place and<br/>
    attach that item.  The disadvantage is that the user may be confused<br/>
    about which item is actually attached, the original or the copy.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Instead of showing other sites in the file picker, let users add<br/>
    an item in the current site, and then in the ""add-item"" dialog, let them<br/>
    choose an existing item from any site they have access to.</li>

The original case mentioned ""I have assigned grades ranging from .5 to 4.5"" - he doesn't want percents and grades, he wants the raw points shown. Trying to satisfy the endless variation in grading style with a simple gradebook is nearly impossible, moving to a variety of grading styles will eventually help, but for now we've got to do our best with one.</p>

<p>So according to the 2.0 specs, and assuming the default grading scale is in place, the student grading report for a student who got a 2.5 points out of 4.5 possible would show something like:</p>

<div class='table-wrap'>
<table class='confluenceTable'><tbody>

<td class='confluenceTd'> 4.5 </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'> F</td>

<p>Probably not the desired result, in this case, but it is following the specs. </p>

<p>So my question is: </p>
<ul>
	<li>What is actually displayed in this case?</li>
	<li>Are the results different than what the specs show?</li>
</ul>


<p>A natural follow up question is what did the instructor want to see, but we can't necessarily use that as our answer, since there's a very strong chance this instructor doesn't want the same thing as most other instructors.</p>

<p>Actually, the spec was just not very clear about this. Mea culpa. For gross class-wide averages, the percentages were supposed to be truncated integers. The student specific percentages with related grade displays were supposed to be truncated at two decimal places. </p>

<p>That said, your approach of first addressing the student view display bug by rounding the percentages down makes sense. I'll enter a 2.1 feature request to introduce a greater measure of precision by either using the raw scores or adding decimals to the percentages as originally intended. </p>

<p>3) For showing mean performance across the entire class, I think it may make more sense to round rather than to truncate. Oliver, Ben, do you agree?</p>

<p>This seems like a good idea. My one hesitation is that it might also be nice to make things simple by applying the same display rules to all of the percentages.</p>

[SAK-2295] Moving folder and inner-folder in same action leads to strange error message,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2295,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Suppose resource collection in site ""X"" contains folders named ""f-1"", ""f-2"" and ""f-3"".  Suppose ""f-1"" contains subfolders named ""f-1.1"" (id == ""/group/X/f-1/f-1.1/"") and ""f-1.2"" (id == ""/group/X/f-1/f-1.2/"").  </p>

<p>Suppose user selects ""f-1"" and ""f-1.1"" and attempts to copy the two items to ""f-2"".  The copy command does a deep-copy, recursively copying each selected item and its contents into the destination.  The result is that ""f-2"" contains two subfolders, ""f-1"" (id == ""/group/X/f-2/f-1/"") and ""f-1.1""  (id == ""/group/X/f-2/f-1.1/"") and the copy of ""f-1"" contains a copy of ""/group/X/f-1/f-1.1/"" whose id is ""/group/X/f-2/f-1/f-1.1/"".</p>

<p>Now suppose user selects ""f-1"" and ""f-1.1"" and attempts to copy the two items to ""f-3"".  The move command does a deep-copy and delete, recursively copying each selected item and its contents into the destination and deleting each one as it completes the copy.  The result is an error message saying the resource/collection does not exist.  Also the selected items will be moved, but not all of the copies will be created as expected. The folder ""f-3"" will contain a subfolder named ""f-1"" (id == ""/group/X/f-3/f-1/""), but ""f-1.1"" will be moved to just one of the two possible places, either in ""f-3"" (id == ""/group/X/f-3/f-1.1/"") or inside the new copy of ""f-1"" (id == ""/group/X/f-3/f-1/f-1.1/"".</p>

<p>The problem here is that the original version of ""f-1.1"" is gone by the time the second copy operation is done.  Move is implemented by copying and then deleting each item, but they are closely coupled.  The deletion is done just after copying is done.

[SAK-2292] Users may see WebDAV resources for another person,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2292,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>I have seen two separate examples of users having access to another user's resources via WebDAV and Sakai.</p>

<p>First, on collab:</p>

<p>Second, on our own installation:</p>

<p>We have enabled RemoteUser, and I don't know how the DavServlet is handling/caching information (IP, username, etc.?).  Basically, the scenario is this:</p>

<p>user1 logs into Sakai<br/>
user1 connects to WebDAV, authenticates, and sees their information. <br/>
user1 closes network places (Windows), but stays logged into Sakai<br/>
user2 logs into Sakai<br/>
user2 tries WebDAV, and enters user1 username and fake password<br/>
user2 can see user1 information.</p>

<p>I wouldn't think remoteuser enabling should cause this, however I am not certain?  I will attempt further to repeat this without container auth set</p>

<p>I just wanted to log this before I forget.</p>

"[SAK-2279] Architectural issue in Total Scores/Standalone support, needs to be covered.",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2279,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>The recent fix using ""AuthzGroupService for the roles of the users instead of just getting the AuthGroup...  for each user."" r 2583, needs to be covered, as it introduces (a very efficient) dependency on running in a Sakai context.</p>

<p>The AuthzQueriesFacadeAPI has two context based implementations, injected by BeanDefinitions.xml and made available through the PersistenceService.<br/>
These are:<br/>
  org.sakaiproject.tool.assessment.facade.authz.integrated.AuthzQueriesFacade<br/>
  org.sakaiproject.tool.assessment.facade.authz.standalone.AuthzQueriesFacade</p>

<p>I suggest you add a wrapper method for the call to AuthzGroupService in AuthzQueriesFacadeAPI, and then implement it in each version.  </p>

<p>It is OK to have the standalone version throw an IllegalArgumentException, as long as  this is indicated in its Javadoc.  You can ask the agent if it is integrated or not, and if it is then call the optimization.  If you need to modify the context driven behavior of the agent, a short explanation follows. </p>

<p>Currently the AgentFacade delegates its static and nonstatic members' integration-context related behavior to a helper interface which is injected by the IntegrationContextFactory.  This was a recent change to eliminate the standalone/integrated build code overlays.</p>

<p>The implementation class is AgentHelperImpl and it is in different packages, <br/>
 org.sakaiproject.tool.assessment.integration.helper.integrated<br/>
 org.sakaiproject.tool.assessment.integration.helper.standalone</p>

<p>The AgentFacade ""knows"" what environment it is running in, even though the delegate implementation class is ""hidden"" form the developer:<br/>

In the user interface, there is context that helps define the meaning of a term if the term is generic, in the same way that a pronoun is defined by its antecedent. So if you add an ""item"" while on the quiz page, it's a quiz item (aka question), but if you add an item in the gradebook, it's a gradebook item. The term is loose enough to linguistically <b>require</b> the context for definition.  </p>

<p>The problem with ""assignment"" is that it is too specific; there is no expectation that the meaning will shift depending on the context. ""Assessment"" is better, but it is still somewhat specific (are students really ""assessed"" on their attendance, or do they simply meet a minimum requirement?). </p>

<p>I think another reason I tend to favor ""item"" is that in actual use, gradebooks don't just contain grades. Given the flexibility, an instructor will use the gradebook as a place for recording other forms of information about the students. WebCT has this flexibility, and the gradebook is often used to record course section, student groups, seating charts, ""response system"" clicker IDs, etc, and these are sometimes used in the ""selective release"" function of WebCT but never as grades. The same is true of paper rosters or Excel spreadsheets.  Sakai can't be used that flexibly (yet) but people will want that and eventually ask for it.</p>

<p>Briefly, ""item"" by itself is probably too generic. One major future requirement on the gradebook is the ability to group, weight etc by category. At first glance, entry seems better, but I wonder if that suggests ""enter score."" Among the generic possibilities, column seems best to me so far.</p>

<p>The problem of how to handle extra student metadata without making a mess of the UI is an interesting one. Between categories, non-enterprise student metadata and what we now call assignments, how many ways will there be to add columns? in which views are they represented? do all have to be combined into a single view?</p>

<p>Ben Brophy, the gradebook designer, has suggested that recording attendance may be better treated as a separate tool that communicates with the GB.</p>

At MIT we plan to use the Gradebook and call it that, but we have no plans to use the Assignment tool, favoring our own Homework tool in it's place. Also, we allow instructors to relabel their tools. So in some cases a class may call it's Homework/Assignment tool ""Problem Sets"" and it's Gradebook tool ""Feedback."" This doesn't effect the precise area of the UI mentioned in this suggestion, but keep in mind the flexibility of labels.</p>

<p>Now on to the ""assignment"" label...</p>

<p>In designing the UI for the gradebook we conducted series of usability test using a prototype (though not in the context of the assignments tool). We gave them the UI and the syllabus of a pretend class and asked them to talk us through how they would set it up, using the prototype. We tried both 'assessment' and 'item' in the UI and found that they lead to confusion. When using Item and to a lesser extent Assessment people weren't sure if that link would do what they needed. When we switched to Assignment, that problem dropped away. </p>

<p>I'm not saying that means we've found the solution and shouldn't change. But I do propose that the change be made on the basis of further usability testing. We'll be doing a round of testing this Fall on the live gradebook tool. We'll share the results and the protocol, and would love to see results from other schools.</p>",,97417,557058:0fb56ab2-a043-427c-ad8c-829b164f7088,"Thu, 30 Aug 2007 01:37:34 -0400","<p>Closing, see the duplicate

 but that is just a partial solution.</p>

<p>The problem is that in a large class there is no easy way for an instructor to tell which students have uploaded material to their dropboxes. We have faculty who initially like the dropboxes call them ""useless"" because of this. Changing the date would allow the instructor to sort the most recent items first; that helps but leaves it up to the instructor to remember when they last accessed the dropboxes.</p>

<p>The dropbox would be more useful if it had active notifications of new items. Possibilities include: </p>
<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>e-mail notification sent to the instructor (as a value that a student could select, like what is done with resources), likewise a notification sent to the dropbox owner when a maintainer adds material.</li>
	<li>A ""new"" flag that appears next to dropboxes that have items added since the last time the maintain account accessed the dropboxes. Ideally the ""new"" flag would appear next to both the folder and the new item.</li>
	<li>A ""hide"" feature that would hide or show older items, leaving just the new items on the page.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of this requires that Sakai track when an account looked at the dropboxes so it could distinguish what is ""new"" versus ""old"" with respect to that user. Doing it with respect to the login date won't work because the user may not have gone to the dropboxes during that session, in which case the content should still appear ""new"" the next time they log in.</p>",,42201,SAK-2269,New item notifications,10012,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10315&avatarType=issuetype,Feature Request,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>When you create a multiple choice question and select the ""randomize answers"" button, the answer choices should be randomized separately for each student who takes the assessment. </p>

<p>Instead, they seem to get randomized once and are the same for each student. </p>

<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<p>1. Create a multiple choice question. Give it 5 possible answers (Name them something obvious, like A through E) and choose the randomize option.</p>

<p>2. Add the question to an assessment and publish it.</p>

<p>3. Take the assessment as a student; when you get to the mc question, note down the order of the answer choices. (ie, what was ABCDE in question creation might now be randomized to BDCAE.)</p>

<p>4. Take the assessment again as a different student.  When you get to the mc question, note the answer choices - are they exactly the same as they were for student 1? They shouldn't be.</p>

The way this was done before was to make attachments totally public.  They were placed in an ""obscure"" place, but anyone who had a URL could retrieve *<b>ANY</b>* attachment.  It's probably not a good idea to handle graded student assignments that way either.</p>

<p>We can do this as you requested, but that opens a huge security issue.  Doing it the right way depends on implementation of finer-grained permissions that allow a site maintainer to grant permissions within a folder on a single resource. Once that is done, we could then have the file-picker make that grant at the time a resource was added in a particular context that is open to just a few people.</p>

<p>All that said, I wonder if there's a work-around.  Could the instructor upload the local file into the student's dropbox for the course through the new file picker?  If so, does that give the right permissions so the student and the instructor (and nobody else) can see the file?</p>",89775,557058:9211a1fd-193f-4f51-a630-ab988381bd36,"Tue, 11 Oct 2005 12:06:10 -0400","<p>The temporary work-around is that instructors <b>AND</b> students should put attachments to students' submissions into the student's dropbox within the course site.  This assigns the <b>best</b> permissions to the attachments.  Both student and instructor should be able to see them, while other students will not.  Attachments to assignments should go into the resources folder for the course site (so everyone in the site can view them).</p>

<p>The fix for this is that the assignments tool needs to be able to tell the file picker the default location for the uploaded attachment.  If it is an attachment to an assignment, the attachment picker should guide the instructor to the site resources folder.  If it is an attachment to a submission, the attachment picker should guide the user (student or instructor) to the individual dropbox.</p>

<p>If the dropbox tool does not exist in this site, there may be no dropbox channel.  In that case, the dropbox channel should be created. </p>",56102,557058:9211a1fd-193f-4f51-a630-ab988381bd36,"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 13:41:49 -0400","<p>This is close to what we discussed.

<p>One of the chief interface complaints we're getting from students and faculty in our pilot is how the back arrow delivers mixed results.  The back arrow will govern navigation between tools and sites, but not successive pages within the workflow of a tool.

<p>Daisy</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </p>

<p>Sure, have a look at SessionUtil. I'm currently setting the timeout to either (the time of the timed assessment + 15 min or 5 hours for a survey). The entry and exit points which call these functions are in the delivery bean. SessionUtil guarantees that the session will have the max of all concurrent threads taking assessments.</p>



<p>In terms of concurrent assessments in the same session, I tried to hash the stored timeout settings into the session but soon realized that the delivery bean object hashed to the same value for concurrent assessments in the same session. A bug will probably need to be created for this. If Samigo had separate delivery beans for two assessments in the same session, then I could have written a totally correct solution. As it stands, the solution works but could be enhanced a bit. </p>



<p>Note: after the assessment is completed the timeout is set to the value that the application (either Sakai or standalone) had it set to before beginning the assessment. This is where SessionUtil can set the timeout to the application value even if there is a concurrent assessment in progress. This is due to the fact that I can't hash on DeliveryBean.</p>

"[SAK-2241] ""Grade Override"" not deleted when student is deleted, prevents editing of grade options",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2241,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<p>1. Set grade options to ""letter grades with +/-""<br/>
2. Add an assignment or two, and go to the ""Course Grade"" screen (final row in the  ""overview"")<br/>
3. Enter a ""Grade overrides"" using +/- values for one student<br/>
4. Delete the student that has an overridden grade<br/>
5. Go back to ""Grade Options"" and try to change the grade type to plain ""letter grades"". Click ""save"" at the bottom of the page</p>

<p>The result is an error that the grade overrides prevent changing the grade type, but returning to the override screen shows nothing because the student with the overridden grade is not shown.</p>

"[SAK-2240] Patch for tests and quizzes reports the latest grade to gradebook, but claims to report best",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2240,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>One of our faculty considers this critical. If you take the same assessment more than once, tests and quizzes claims to report the best score to Gradebook. It claims this in Settings/Grading. There's no way to change the option, but if you look at a released test, it shows options Average and Best, with Bests chosen and the choice grayed out.</p>

<p>We think best actually makes sense.</p>

<p>The following patch, against 2090, will implement best. Note that the student will now see the latest in the Tests and Quizzes feedback, but the best in Gradebook. I believe that's right. After taking a test, the student will want to see feedback on their latest attempt. So Tests and Quizes shows that. But Gradebook will show the best result.</p>

<p>The enclosed  patch implements a syntax such as %F%100,10  for a value of 100 plus or minus 10. %F% is intended to be expandable to flags for other kinds of answer processing. F is, of course, for floating point.</p>

"[SAK-2232] tests and quizzes reports the latest grade to gradebook, but claims to report best",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2232,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>One of our faculty considers this critical. If you take the same assessment more than once, tests and quizzes claims to report the best score to Gradebook. It claims this in Settings/Grading. There's no way to change the option, but if you look at a released test, it shows options Average and Best, with Bests chosen and the choice grayed out.</p>

<p>We think best actually makes sense.</p>

<p>The following patch, against 2090, will implement best. Note that the student will now see the latest in the Tests and Quizzes feedback, but the best in Gradebook. I believe that's right. After taking a test, the student will want to see feedback on their latest attempt. So Tests and Quizes shows that. But Gradebook will show the best result.</p>

"[SAK-2231] clarify getting and setting ""current user"" in the framework support",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2231,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Getting the current user is done in two different ways; using the UsageSessionService (legacy, the old way) and using the SessionManager (kernel, new and approved way).  The UsageSessionService has support for non-request threads to establish a user for further processing, but the kernel dpes not.  This leads to confusion about how code should find the current user, and how in special cases it should change it.</p>

<p>Make the kernel method the prefered and most likely used way to get the current user; extend it so that a session is always delievered, even for non-request threads (this session will be temporary, good only for the thread execution), so that a current user can always be found using the current sessions's getUserId(), or a new manager level getCurrentSessionUserId() which is safe to call even if there's no current session (not going to happen, but lets be safe).</p>

<p>The UsagesSessionService is all about the database stored usage session record, to track the user's login session; usage events are linked to this record.  It is not really about the in-memory session management; that's what the kernel' session API is for.  Remove the support for thread-local non-request current user here.  Remove or deprecate getSessionUserId(). </p>

<p>Change as much code as possible to use the kernel instead of the UsageSessionService.  Change the thread based code (maillet and others) to set the ""user"" via the session's setUserId() method instead of the UsageSessionService's method.</p>

"[SAK-2226] Interface inconsistency, may lead to display of incorrect student grade",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2226,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>The instructor's ""overview"" page of the gradebook displays ""Due Date"", ""Average"", and ""Points"". The student view displays an additional letter grade from the  ""Grade Conversion"" that is calculated according to the formula entered on the instructors ""grade options"" page. The instructor does <b>not</b> see this letter grade.</p>

<p>The assumption here is that the instructor has previously gone to the ""grade options"" to enter the correct grade conversion.  If the instructor fails to do that, the ""curve"" may be incorrect and the students will see grades that have no bearing to how well they are actually doing in the course. </p>

<p>Since the instructor does not see the grade conversion on the main view or roster view of the gradebook, there is <b>no feedback</b> that the grade conversion is happening, or that it is correct or incorrect. There is no incentive to actually go to the ""grade options"" screen to do the right thing, the instructor must have <b>prior</b> knowledge of how the tool works in order to know to set it up correctly. Even if the instructor does visit the ""grade options"" screen it is not clear what the grade conversion is used for or where that displays, the instructor would actually have had to visit a course with a student account to understand this clearly. </p>

Unfortunately, your suggestion may not provide such a straightforward solution.</p>

<p>The ""Overview"" page you mention does not display the marks for an individual student's assignments. It gives you the entire class's average performance on the assignments. You probably meant to refer to the roster view in your suggestion. The roster view contains all of the scores for each of the students. There are two choices here, I think. We could add extra data to each score cell <span class=""error"">&#91;9/10, A-&#93;</span>or provide a cumulative calculated grade for all assignments. </p>

<p>The first choice was rejected by the design team because it made for a lot of clutter. The latter option was not considered viable because we didn't have time to build in finer grained instructor control over the accuracy of the cumulative course grade at any point in time. Another feature that we had to scrap was a view of individual students (linked to from the roster names) that would have given instructors the same data the students themselves see. There are existing designs for both of these potential solutions.</p>

<p>Do you have any other suggestions?</p>",89800,557058:4391af8f-aa8c-4c73-9de8-3045f273010b,"Wed, 12 Oct 2005 06:52:15 -0400","<p>Of course your right about the roster page vs the overview page.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to set the default grade conversion to null, then change the student display to show nothing until the instructor fills in the grade conversion. This is probably a better approach in the long run, because it avoids the situation of the technology ""deciding"" how a course will be graded (which is how some faculty I work with are likely to see it). </p>

<p>I still think there needs to be some more apparent indicator either on the overview page or the roster page that the grade conversion is being displayed to the student - the equivalent of the ""student view"" in tests and quizzes, or maybe just an ""on/off"" indicator. </p>",173588,557058:9cd19dd3-e6f4-4916-9e00-0b7ef570059c,"Wed, 26 Oct 2005 12:45:20 -0400","<p>Oliver, is this issue scheduled to be addressed for 2.1.0, or should it become a feature request?

A Sakai system being used exclusively for CMS might want to let the Instructors or Campus policy have the ultimate say-so in whether or not individuals can affect digest delivery, whereas a Sakai system being used to support globaly distrubted research collaborations might want to let end-users have the ultimate say-so on digest delivery so they can match their daily work habits in their local timezone.</p>",69537,5a8239916a4cf333658aebcf,"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 04:18:22 -0500","<p>I know this is an old thread, but in case someone else is looking into this:</p>

<p>One possible approach, with the given code in Sakai, is to have a standard time for restarting your server and setting the email.digest.start.delay (sakai.property) to correspond with the preferred time for your digest. Obviously, if you do a restart at a different time you will have a different digest time and may get a few upset users.</p>",186433,70121:ec0fd122-4a2d-4492-a966-78d3f9aa9080,"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 06:41:16 -0500","<p>Right, I'd responded on the dev list a few years ago about this and how you could put in an function to dynamically calculate the delay based on what time you wanted it to start.</p>

<p>However this doesn't solve the problem of user specific delays, which I think is what this was asking for. It would be <b>nice</b> if it had a timer actually checked preferences for users, and this timer (BaseDigestService) checked these preferences. Would have to make sure that check has good performance (all defined custom times cached). I'm not sure how much interest there is in this anyway.</p>

<p>=<del>=</del>=<del>=</del>=<del>=</del>=<del>=</del>=<del>=</del>=-=<br/>
Just as a followup, there is a property: email.digest.start.delay<br/>
(seconds default 300) which you could 'kind of' rig to get the start<br/>
time you desire. It's the number of seconds that the server starts up,<br/>
but you'd have to modify it every time in the current setup<br/>
unfortunately.</p>

<p>The best way would be if you had a set restart time (Like your servers<br/>
restarted a few times a week at 5AM to clean out the session cache,<br/>
etc.) and you knew when you wanted to send it, that might fulfill your<br/>
needs without having to recode anything.</p>

<p>Or if you're not sure when you'll start up but you'll know it'll be<br/>
before 5PM, you can write some shell script in bash (have an original<br/>
sakai.properties file that you'll append to)</p>

<p>cp sakai.properties.original sakai.properties<br/>
echo `date +%s -d '5PM'` - `date +%s` | xargs -I{} echo ""a={};if<br/>
(a&lt;0)a=a+(60*60*24);a"" | bc | xargs echo email.digest.start.delay= &gt;&gt;<br/>
sakai.properties</p>

<p>(That extra bit in the middle fixes for negative time by waiting until tomorrow)</p>

<p>It can do whatever you want it to do though though in the code.</p>",103630,557058:51461b21-2c63-4db1-8fb0-e8baae82b107,"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 08:34:36 -0400",<p>CLE team bulk inactive issues cleanup - if this is important then reopen or create a new issue</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,User Experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[SAK-2198] RSS view on email archive,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2198,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>The email archive tool should provide an RSS view on the archive, highlighting the most recent posts. This adds the capability of following the cutting edge in an RSS reader, while relying upon Sakai email archives to store the archive more permanently (doesn't fill the user's inbox). Provides nice website integration opportunities. Note that such a feed would be much more valuable if each item could provide a hyperlink to the message in the context of the Sakai email archive.</p>

<p>In the case where authentication is required to see the email archive, there is a problem to be solved here in terms of how to provide end users with URLs that will work in their RSS readers of choice.  One solution is to generate ad-hoc large unique identifiers suitable for use as keys and expose RSS URLs accepting these keys only to access the RSS feed (without granting more general access to Sakai).  In the case of publicly accessible email archives this wrinkle isn't required.</p>

1. instead of one very long method, I organized tasks into individual methods so it is easier to read<br/>
2. a no. of methods, such as setFirstItem, setRandomPart and setAnsweredItems need not be called once it is set. So I added indicator for that purpose<br/>
3. I move some of the bean population back to be done inside bean<br/>
4. I added 3 hibernate methods so we can get info from database when we need to. This avoid double while loop and allow us to have lazy loading on AssessmentGradingData.itemGradingSet<br/>
5. after update score and comment, we only need to call TotalScoreUpdateListener, no need to call TotalScoreListener as well - unnecessary.</p>

<p>Megan: please do a heavy duty test on teh totalScoring page. Note that sorting is not working on this page. This bug exists before my checkin. I have reported it to Margaret this morning. I have 2 blockers to fix. After I done that, I can come back to fix sorting if it has not been assigned to someone else.</p>

[SAK-2182] Remember Number of Items User Decides to Display in a List View,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2182,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>The page widget should remember the user's last setting for a paticular tool and use that setting the next time the user visits it (yes, across sessions). We've taken a guess at a meaningful default but there are so many factors involved in the setting that an individual user is the best judge of this. Because it's an easy change for the user we don't want to force them to choose a preference. Instead remember what they had it set to last time. They'll be using their preferred viewing for that particular tool most of the time so it will be set up the way they want it the next time they visit. If they were doing a less common task that required a different than normal setting than it just takes a change of the dropdown to fix it. Notice the less common here. It is a real pain if they have to change the setting everytime they visit the page. Here and there when they were doing an infrequent task is OK.</p>

[SAK-2160] Gradebook AuthZ filter not working,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2160,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Verified below report on UCB's 2.0 QA instance.</p>

<p>We found a security related bug yesterday in Assignments, and it appears to exist in Gradebook and Syllabus as well. Very obscure, and hard to see how a student could uncover it, but it's there nonetheless, and one of our QA folks thought of it, so... It allows students to change their grade in Assignment or Gradebook, or edit a Syllabus item. A student could I suppose install Sakai themselves, and in fooling around discover a back door to enabling them to get to otherwise unpermitted edit pages.</p>

<p>They can do this by pasting in the equivalent of the instructor's URL to the grade page or syllabus edit page.</p>

<p>So as an instructor, go to the Gradebook, and right click over one of the assignments in the list and save the URL.<br/>
Logout, and log back in with a student account. Paste the URL in and you can get to where you can change grades.</p>

<p>Someone would have to know the format of the URL etc., so not likely. You'd have to be an instructor  to get it.<br/>

But if someone installed their own private Sakai, and was fooling around, they might come across it, and the next day it's on a Sakai hack website, and the next day students everywhere just got smarter.</p>

<p>Zhen just checked in a fix (2156) to the problem in assignments. Perhaps she can provide add'l info if needed. There is talk of a 2.0.1 'official' patch, w/ notification sent to contacts only of those running pilots to try to keep knowledge of the problem contained.</p>

I presume you made that decision to reflect the limited functionality of the first release, where a single section category list is supported deployment wide.<br/>
But if there's any possibility of site-specific categories being supported in the foreseeable future, it might be safer to have the interface take a site context argument and just document the restricted functionality of the first implementation. That way all the section-aware clients won't have to change their code if the restriction is ever lifted.</p>

[SAK-2113] Server Configuration Service prevents kernel modularity,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2113,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>The Sakai kernel and related software is almost capable of standing on it's own. The one piece of software that prevents a Sakai platform bundle is the legacy ServerConfigurationService and it's implementation in BasicConfigurationService.</p>

<p>In general, this service provides access to system configuration parameters, but it also provides convenience methods for commonly used URLs.  It is this mix of functions that causes problems.</p>

<p>I propose a new service, perhaps ServerConfigurationManager that is focused purely on server configuration parameters.  I propose that we move URL methods and Resource Service registration to another service, since neither are directly needed by the kernel, Mercury, or the LoginTool.  This in turn would remove dependencies in the implementation on UsageSessionService, ResourceService, SiteService, and CurrentService &#8211; all legacy services outside of the kernel.</p>

<p>I think that this new service should be part of the kernel, since it serves a core purpose in configuring Sakai.</p>

<p>I have attached a proposed ServerConfigurationManager API and an implementation called KernelConfigurationService that works in conjunction with Mercury and LoginTool.</p>

"[SAK-7863] Use a Single ""Name"" to identifiy Resources",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-7863,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>A continuing source of confusion for users is the lack of correlation between the Title of a Resource and the ID by which the system knows the Resource.  In general, users are expecting Resources to behave in a manner similar to their computer's file system.  A single ""name"" should be used to identify Resources for all purposes in the UI and should be part for any internal logic, such as not allowing duplicates.</p>

<p>Resources violates the user's expectations in a number of ways currenlty, such as by only looking at a Resource's system ID and ignoring the Title when a user performs actions which result in duplicate names.  For example, users can end up with two or more Resources with identical Titles.  The system knows the Resources are different because each was assigned a unique ID when it was uploaded, however, the user cannot necessarily tell from the UI what's going on.  Also, they may attempt to upload a new version of a file using the same Title assuming that it will replace the old version; it does not, instead you end up with two identically named Resources.</p>",,55053,SAK-7863,"Use a Single ""Name"" to identifiy Resources",10012,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10315&avatarType=issuetype,Feature Request,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

 provides another example of user-confusion resulting from multipe ""names"" for a Resource.

 is another example of confusion resulting from the different references by which a Resource is known.

First I'm not sure that the expected behavior is as described in this ticket. And if it is the expected behavior, there's no efficient way to achieve that behavior.</p>

<p>The problem is real. We can't have two items in the same collection with the same resource-id, but we can have multiple items in a collection with the same display-name.  Having more than one item with the same display-name is likely to lead to confusion for users. But how do we make sure there are not duplicate display names? </p>

<p>The problem is most likely to occur when the user uploads more than one copy of the same file (possibly a revised version of a file uploaded earlier).  We already have a way of making sure we don't have duplicate resource-id's in that case, and an efficient way of assigning variations on the resource-id to allow creation of the new item.  If a resource-id is already taken, we insert a number into the ""desired"" resource-id and try again.  If the resource-id with the number inserted is already in use, we increment the number and try again.  We keep doing that until we find an unused id, or until some arbitrary limit on the number of attempts has been exceeded.  If we find a valid id, we save the uploaded file.  This process is relatively efficient because the Content Hosting Service enables a very efficient query to see if a resource-id is in use.</p>

<p>There is not such an efficient way of finding whether a particular display-name has been used in a folder. Since this is most likely to occur when someone uploads multiple copies of the same file, one approach might be to add the same number to the display-name that is added to the resource-id when a clash is encountered. That would work for simple cases, but it doesn't cover some cases, and in others it might actually get in the user's way.  For example, a user might upload a file name ""file.doc"" and assign a display-name of ""First version"", and then upload a revision of the same file assigning ""Second version"" as the display-name.  Assuming ""file.doc"" was not already in use as a resource-id in that folder, these two files would be assigned resource-id's of ""file.doc"" and ""file-1.doc"", but the display-names would be ""First version"" and ""Second version (1)"".   And suppose someone next uploaded two versions of a file named ""sample.doc"" assigning display-names of ""First version"" and ""Second version"".  Now we'd have two files with display-names of ""First name"" and two files with display-names of ""Second version (1)"".</p>

<p>This suggests that we should check every time we add an item to a folder to make sure that the user-assigned display-name is not already in use in that folder.  This would involve getting a list of all resources in the folder.  Then for each resource, we would check to see if it has the same display-name as the user-assigned display-name for the new item.  If we find one that has the same display-name, we would change the name (add the next number in the sequence) and start over, checking the new candidate against the display-name of each other item in the folder.  We would keep doing that until we find a variation that is not already in use.  </p>

<p>This approach would be likely to have a noticeable impact on performance.  </p>

<p>BTW, the desired behavior described in this ticket is close to what we have done in the case of duplicating a resource within a folder. But even in that case, it could be wrong. The number added to the display-name might not relate to the number of copies that are actually in that folder.  If items get deleted or moved, the numbering might not be sequential.  And we could end up with multiple numbers added to a display-name (for example, ""Copy of Copy of file.txt (2) (3)"").</p>",189477,557058:9cd19dd3-e6f4-4916-9e00-0b7ef570059c,"Sat, 24 Sep 2005 11:11:44 -0400","<p>Mamta, As Jim points out, Sakai is currently behaving ""as designed"".

"[SAK-2101] Cannot distinguish read and unread messages, or new and old messages",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2101,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>I'm filing this as a ""bug"" rather than a ""feature request"" because the omission of the feature is so flawed that it makes the discussion tool eventually  become completely useless.</p>

<p>There is no method in Sakai to distinguish between messages that have previously been read and new or unread messages. Threaded discussions often allow you to hide messages that have previously been read (e.g., WebCT), provide some visual indicator that the message has not been viewed yet, or have a filtered search for new messages. At a very minimum, and usually the case in unthreaded discussions, there is a link to the first new message in each category since the user's last visit.</p>

<p>Because the current implementation of the discussion tool fails to provide any method to differentiate between new and old messages, the user is forced to remember the date that they last read messages and scan the message list for posting dates that are more recent. Typical usage at Rutgers of a discussion board in a large lecture course can result in thousands of messages per term, so manually scanning posting dates would be too cumbersome and time consuming to be practical. </p>

<p>The synoptic ""home"" view of discussion does show the most recent posts (limited by quantity and date) so could help alleviate the problem, but since there is no link from the ""home"" page directly to the discussion message or topic, you end up needing to scan the message list anyway to find the new messages that you know are there. </p>

<p>Finally, because of the way the links are written you cannot even use stylesheets to differentiate ""visited"" links - to the web browser each discussion link is identical, effectively disabling the built-in ability to distinguish between visited and unvisited links.  </p>",,46470,SAK-2101,"Cannot distinguish read and unread messages, or new and old messages",10012,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10315&avatarType=issuetype,Feature Request,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

.)  Being able to create Categories but not Topics is a strange combination indeed, and being eable to create both or neither seem like the primary pedagogical choices here.  (Currently there is no support for being able to create Topics but not Categories, but that doesn't seem to have many use cases behind it.)</p>

<p>(2) Should Access be able to create new Categories and Topics with the default out-of-the-box permissions?  There are folks who provide use cases to support both ways of doing this, but only one can be supported by default.  The other use case, however, should be easily achievable by adjusting the permissions; see above point.  Currently the directed-discussion style-of-use, where Access (e.g., Students) can only reply to exisiting Topics/Categories was the consensus default, therefore, changing the default to match the more loosely-controlled discussion is really a design change and needs to be treated as a Feature Request.  </p>",55758,557058:9cd19dd3-e6f4-4916-9e00-0b7ef570059c,"Wed, 28 Sep 2005 12:57:26 -0400","<p>Part (2), the Feature Request asepct, has been cloned to

<p>I know that the GB was designed so that the grades needed to be changed from the tool they come from (presently this would only be Samigo).  However, if a student doesn't take an assessment in Samigo,  there is no entry for them on the scores page; making it impossible to adjust the score. In addition if multiple assessments need to be released (accessability issue) for 1 Assignment in a gradebook, there is no way to link the assessments up. </p>

<p>A use cases</p>
<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>a student that for some reason needed to take the exam in paper form.</li>
	<li>due to a learning disability a student would need extra time on a timed assessment.  Multiple assessments would need to be released (right now the only way I see to do this restriction on this is via IP but this will likely change once sectioning/groups is implemented).  However, it's impossible to have these grades automatically enter into the GB since the assessments would created assignments in the GB that applied to all students.</li>
</ul>

<p>We don't show a student a misleading score of ""0"" if no score has been entered yet, so the extra time scenario doesn't seem to apply.

<p>And obviously the gradebook code has no idea whether an exam is being taken in paper form or not &#8211; the score gets updated whenever you want to update it.

<p>Samigo doesn't use the Gradebook for score storage. It lets us know when it's made changes, but it doesn't read Gradebook scores back again. If we supported ""gradebook override"", the instructors, students, and TAs would see completely different results when looking at the same assessments in the two tools. To make it as easy as possible for instructors to jump to the right place in the external assessment tool to change a grade that they're viewing in the Gradebook, the Gradebook API accepts a URL to link to. That link (if available) will be displayed alongside the externally-maintained score. (I don't remember any more why this feature isn't being taken advantage of &#8211; it was some missing piece of functionality in the portal framework or Samigo or both.)</p>

<p>There's also the UI complexity that the Gradebook would have to deal with to ""unlock"" externally maintained scores, and the question of how external assessment engines deal with their scores being ""unlocked"" &#8211; so, all in all, it seemed safest for the external assessment tool to handle special ""manual override"" cases itself. That is, if a test being administered via Samigo has to be taken on paper by some student, then the grader would go to Samigo and input the grades there. That way the student can get the same level of feedback as all the students who took the test online. (Samigo has far more powerful student feedback features than the Gradebook.)</p>",2.0.1,90205,557058:7b8d5e40-cb45-48ab-a0ab-911e8ed719f2,"Thu, 27 Oct 2005 08:25:24 -0400","<p>I apologize for not adding a comment in response to this earlier.

Subject: RE: FERPA flag</p>

<p>These are good points and well taken.  The ""FERPA"" flag should, for all<br/>
practical purposes, be called the ""privacy"" flag as it is not specific to<br/>
FERPA and can easily be renamed.  However, in its current implementation it<br/>
is coarse-grained and only affects behavior of the new Roster Tool.  It is<br/>
like a big privacy switch; either on or off.</p>

<p>I agree that moving forward there should be a much finer-grained option<br/>
available.  It would be useful for implementers that have concerns in these<br/>
privacy areas to begin spec'ing out a design as to how it should be<br/>
implemented and how the behavior of the application should respond to a<br/>
finer-grained mechanism.</p>

[SAK-2077] Assignments Option for Automatically Accepting Resubmissions,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2077,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>A critical requirement for an assignement, when the focus is on 'process' more than a final 'product', is for the instructor to review a student's progress and give them feedback along the way. In an unstructured setting where there are no firm dates for submitting versions for review, or where students are encouraged to revise and submit often, with or without feedback, students need to be allowed to resubmit whenever they need to.  In the current Assignment workflow, each student needs to contact the Instructor or TA and ask them to go to their current submission and return it whenever they want to update their work. </p>

<p>So, when creating an assignment, an instructor should be able to select an option that allows automatic resubmission for that assignment.  Resubmissions would be allowed up until the Due Date; it might also be desirable to limit the student to x number of resubmissions (specific use case?).   Students and Instructors should be able to view previous submissions too, not just the most recent one.</p>

<p>This option may also be useful (and perhaps the right default in general?) if an instructor does not care when an assignment is submitted, as long as it is submitted before the due date.  This would allow students to re-submit on their own when they notice they've forgotten something or submitted the wrong assignement, without having to contact the instructor and wait for their assignment to be returned.</p>",,55030,SAK-2077,Assignments Option for Automatically Accepting Resubmissions,10017,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10318&avatarType=issuetype,Task,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

I imagine that there are at least two separate use cases.</p>

<p>1-- auto-submission on due date.  The student wants to draft and draft and draft, but doesn't want to have to remember to return to the site that one time to submit the assignment.  In this case, the instructor doesn't expect to see the students drafts marked as ""submitted"" until the due date.  Since the instructor doesn't see it until the due date, she doesn't assess the ""wrong"" version if she begins to grade the early submissions before the due date.</p>

<p>If we allowd students to opt in to auto-submission (provided the instructor first opts-in to allowing it), then  students won't have to submit at all.  They could just keep drafting.  Maybe it wouldn't even <b>have</b> a submit button in that case, just save!  That could cut down on both accidental submission problems and failure to submit problems. </p>

<p>But it could introduce different problems. The instructor may give the student(s) a verbal extension.  Unless she modifies the due date, the system will manually turn in students (unfinished? blank?) work.  In that case, the instructor would need to indeed return the auto-submission manually.  And what about students who fail to do the work?  Would the system turn in blank work.  Will the instructor be mad at ""the system"" for making her page through blank submissions?  We've got instructors who post optional assignments.  Would the system auto-submit these as well?  How does the Gradebook currently import null submissions?  Zeros?  Making the instructor go back and seek out auto-submitted work and treat it differently will create a whole new set of support issues.</p>

<p>To what extent will we be trading one problem (accidental submission before the due date) for another (accidental submission on the due date)?   In the face-to-face world, the instructor doesn't come to your dorm room and take your draft off your desktop if you miss class.  Not that we should live virtually by physical rules, but that the physical model might inform us of further complications.  </p>

<p>2-- drop-box-esque assignment type.  The student re-submits and re-submits and re-submits up until the due date and the instructor can view/respond to these incremental submissions.  Once the system allows for incremental submissions, instructors may <b>expect</b> to be able to view and respond to these early submissions-- like they can now to submitted work.  For instance, the first draft is due by Oct 1, second draft by Oct 7, final by Oct 21).  How might that work?  Would the feedback be logged like the Gradebook grade is logged?  Will sltudents' previous submissions be accessible to them, to the instructor?  Furthermore, could they opt to select a earlier version of their work as their final submission?  </p>

<p>This requirement is about accidental submission and accidental failure to submit, but the larger idea of Resubmission exposes a range of interactions for consideration.</p>",2.3.1,112872,557058:4391af8f-aa8c-4c73-9de8-3045f273010b,"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 04:33:42 -0500","<p>There needs to be some granularity to the resubmission option. I see four likely use cases</p>

<p>1. an instructor wants to allow resubmissions for the entire class as part of the assignment process (automatic resubmission, as described in the opening comment)<br/>
2.  an instructor initially wants only one submission, but may choose to re-open the assignment resubmissions for the entire class at some point<br/>
3. an instructor only wants one submission, but chooses to allow a limited group of students to resubmit <br/>
4. an instructor only wants one submission, but chooses to allow individual students to resubmit</p>

<p>Currently Sakai only allows #4.

Problems / situation requires a need to change / update the assessment to allow all to re-submit the assignment whether or not they had submitted it in the first run.</p>

<p>Currently, we have no choice other than to advise the instructor to:<br/>
  a.  create another assessment item and insist that all students submit here.<br/>

[SAK-2074] Improve Hibernate handling in Sakai component system,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2074,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>(I'm starting this off with minor priority since it addresses no end-user functionality. It just improves life for developers and deployers.)</p>

<p>Currently, any Sakai component implementation which relies on Hibernate to handle persistence must be split into two JAR archives:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One containing Hibernate mapping files, Hibernate-mapped classes, and any classes they refer to. This JAR is placed in a shared-memory area of the web server &#8211; conventionally ""shared/lib"".</li>
	<li>One containing the remainder of the business logic which implements the service interface.</li>
</ul>


<p>This split is problematic for several reasons.</p>

<p>First, the DB mapping is logically part of the implementation and is most naturally maintained, tracked, and bundled with it. This division unnecessarily complicates directory layouts, builds, and deployments.</p>

<p>Second, due to J2EE classloader constraints, putting classes in shared-memory forces all the classes to which they refer to <em>also</em> be put in shared memory. This results either in massive pollution of the shared area, which causes library version contention, or (more likely) in artificially constraining the logic of Hibernate-mapped objects, making them simple data holders rather than object-oriented code. This defeats one point of an ORM system such as Hibernate: to map regular full-featured Java classes to a DB.</p>

<p>Third, there's no built-in clean-up of obsolete ""shared/lib"" JARs from Maven. (That might be addressed by changing the Maven Sakai plug-in, though.)</p>",,42136,SAK-2074,Improve Hibernate handling in Sakai component system,10012,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10315&avatarType=issuetype,Feature Request,10003,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/minor.svg,Minor,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

I found a few problems with the tool that I've reported below along with a few design issues.  I've tried to separate them out and to prioritize them, because the problems are a higher priority than the design issues.  You may not have been ready for me to take a look at this yet, so if I've looked at it too early and you're not quite finished, I apologize.  <img class=""emoticon"" src=""/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png"" height=""16"" width=""16"" align=""absmiddle"" alt="""" border=""0""/></p>

<p>Problems</p>

<p>1. I chose to hide my personal information and when I returned to the Roster tool and selected my Profile, my personal information is still available.  I should see 'No personal information is available for this user' and my photo should not appear.  In it's place I should see the 'No Official Photo is Available' box.  Additionally, my picture is still available when I click 'Show Pictures'.  I should see the 'No Official Photo is Available' box.<br/>
2. I am seeing the same behavior when I select 'Hide my entire profile'.<br/>
3. First name field seems to be using the last name field. When I click Profile next to my name, My first name displays as Hancock and my last name displays as Hancock, even though it is correct in the Profile tool in My Workspace.<br/>
4. I am seeing some weird behavior when I view a Profile, Cancel out of that Profile, navigate to another site and then return.  What happens is the profile is displaying inline.  Here are the steps I take to reproduce the problem:</p>

<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>From the Show Roster view, select the Profile link</li>
	<li>Click Cancel</li>
	<li>You should now be in the Show Roster view</li>
	<li>Navigate to another site - My Workspace for example</li>
	<li>Now navigate back to your original site</li>
	<li>The Roster tool appears, but the profile you just viewed appears inline.  When trying to click Cancel, nothing happens.  I have to click the Reset button for the tool to get back to the Show Roster view.</li>
</ul>


<p>5. Other Information added by the user doesn't appear when viewing the user's profile from the Roster tool.</p>


<p>Design</p>

<p>1. The Role (e.g., access and maintain) and All Users should be shown in a bar as shown in SR-1 (pg. 3) and SR-4 (pg. 6) of the Site Roster design doc.<br/>
2. We need to add a space between the role and the number of users in that role and between All Users and the total number of users as shown in SR-1 and SR-4 of the Site Roster design doc.<br/>
3. The title for Photo ID when user selects 'Show Official Photo ID' is 'Picture' and title for Picture when user selects 'Show Pictures' is 'Photo ID'.  These titles need to be switched.<br/>
4. Is it possible to hyperlink the Home Page as shown in SR-5 (pg. 7) of the design doc?<br/>
5. Is it possible to center the user's info with the picture rather than aligning the user's info with the top of the picture as shown in SR-3 (pg. 5) of the design doc?<br/>
6. Is it possible to enable the sort by user or user ID as shown in SR-1 (pg. 3) and SR-4 (pg. 6) of the design doc?</p>",105985,557058:7de2ab13-8709-4670-9284-528b2fbf8b90,"Wed, 21 Sep 2005 06:38:47 -0400","<p>I wanted to add a comment to the first 2 problems I reported.  I tested this a bit further today and found that other users cannot see information that I have chosen to hide.  Therefore, these problems are not quite as high priority as I first thought.  However, if the user chooses to hide his/her information, the user should not see this information either in the Roster tool.  Otherwise, the user will think that other users have access to their information even though they don't.</p>

<p>I did find one additional problem when testing with multiple users.  When viewing users by role in the Show Roster view, the alignment is of center.  The Profile, Name and User ID columns for the maintain user are farther to the right than the same columns for the access user.  Not a big problem, just a cosmetic issue.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you need any additional information to replicate the problems I've described above.

At present RWiki does not maintain state, hecne navigating away from the tool and returning causes the tool state to reset to the home page. This is not right.</p>

<p>Solutions.....<br/>
We can catch onbody_unload events but FF will only inform and will not prevent unloads, IE is perfectly happy to prevent a people from unloading. It's probably possible to capture the state of the form/whole tool and store in cookies but maybe a lot of javascript magic</p>

<p>using the above trick we can store the state in the client, hence when you open 2 windows, 2 seperate client sessions they both have seperate state. If we do this server side, it will become impossible to have 2 threads of viewing in the wiki tool. We will try the client side state first. Lots of dificulty, like 4k cookies etc. (could use ajax!)</p>

<p>Ultimately we want to be able to store tool state, client side, per session.</p>",72797,6164da5799b4b8006a0abd36,"Thu, 6 Oct 2005 03:27:28 -0400","<p>We will try and get this into the code freeze using the Sakai Session State service. </p>

State should be maintained on on location in the site (easy), and if in an edit page, the current state of the edit page when you move away should be saved (hard)</p>

<p>Imp:<br/>
Server Site session stores the pageid and function on a per tool basis, and causes reload to that place when the user comes into home.</p>

<p>On the edit page, state is stored to a cookie on unload and restored on load.

<p>In the edit page I would _<em>not</em>_ expect to retain state if I moved away, but it may be useful to warn me that my edits will be lost if I move away from the page if this can be accomplished easily with javascript.

<p>The TITLE one types into the Options page is represented in the iFrame wrapper only.</p>

<p>It makes sense that these two fields can have different text.  It doesn't make sense that the fields are called the same thing.  The user thinks it's a bug that she changes the title but the title doesn't change.</p>

<p>Perhaps the title for the tool navigation could be called ""tool title"" and the title for the iframe could be called something like ""tool sub-title"".  Would be grand if both could be edited from the Options page.  If not, then perhaps the Options page could include a hint on where to change the nav tool title.</p>

[SAK-2057] auto-submit shouldn't be checked if a timed assessment isn't selected,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2057,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>We had an instructor contact us because he had published an assessment in Samigo and had 26 students take it.  When he went to look at the scores, only 12 students showed up as having taken the test.  Further investigation into the matter revealed that students who had manually submitted the assessment were the ones that were showing up, and those that had relied on Auto Submit were missing.  We managed to recover the submitted assessments that were not showing up for the instructor, but this seems like a significant flaw.</p>

<p>Authors should <b>not</b> have the ability to publish an assessment with the following combinations: </p>

<p>No time restrictions AND Auto-submit checked<br/>
**Assessment will never be submitted as in IM270077</p>

<p>   or </p>

<p>Time restrictions given AND Auto-submit unchecked<br/>
**Assessment will not be submitted </p>

<p>I can't think of a use case where someone would want a time restriction put on an assessment and <b>not</b> want the assessment to submit after the time limit has expired.  This leads me to the question of whether auto-submit should even be an option, or if it should happen by default for a timed assessment.  </p>",Windows / MAC  IE / Firefox,42119,SAK-2057,auto-submit shouldn't be checked if a timed assessment isn't selected,10007,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype,Bug,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

""For timed assessments, auto-submit should be selected unless you allow late student submissions after the time limit."" </p>

"[SAK-34830] Support for Import/export pools, release tests to groups, better web editor..etc",https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-34830,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>I'm copying Charles' email here to keep track of them in JIRA.   </p>


<p>Charles Hedrick &lt;hedrick@rutgers.edu&gt;</p>

<ul>
	<li>we need to be able to copy sites, export them, and import them. This has to include test content. Examples: creating a new semester based on the old, transferring responsibility to a new faculty member. Saying that I can export tests as QTI is not a good answer. (1) there will be lots of tests. I don't want to have to do each one individually (2) if tests are based on a pool, the pool also has to be copied (3) there are going to be lots of tools in Sakai. We can't have a separate export/import function for each one. Faculty expect to be able to export or move the whole site.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
	<li>we need to be able to export and import tests that use pools. I<br/>
realize this is complex. I'm willing to accept a compromise where the exported copy only has pointers to the pool items. Then to successfully move the test, you'd need to move the pools.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
	<li>we need to be able to export and import pools. It would also be<br/>
useful to give others access to the pool. In particular, it would be useful to give admin access to pools. I can't debug any user problems with tests involving pools because I can't see their pools. I believe they will also want colleagues to be able to see them.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
	<li>we need to do something about getting tests from publishers. A<br/>
possible workaround involves getting the tests in QTI format (e.g. by importing into blackboard from the publisher and exporting as QTI). That requires better QTI support.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
	<li>faculty need to be able to do makeup tests. They want to make them available just to a few students. I have two suggestions. One is release to a group. Presumably that will happen as part of the current work to support sections. But another approach is something like the anonymous quiz that isn't anonymous. I.e. like anonymous it generates a URL, which you have to give to the students. But it would require a login and report who took it. With these special and makeup tests, the faculty really need to know who took them.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
	<li>the ability to change the default template. Default settings will<br/>
differ among institutions.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
	<li>a better web editor. HTMLArea isn't quite functional enough. Sferyx has the right functionality, but it takes too long to start and is going to generate support problems. I'm going to have to talk 50,000 students through downloading and installing Java, and all the Mac users will require hand-holding through the java shim installation.  Furthermore, even after installing the shim, Mac browsers are a bit iffy with Java. Furthermore, Sferyx is hard with tests. There are a number of text areas on the same page that need an editor. Sferyx is too big to put in each of the areas. So I end up starting it as a separate window, with buttons under each blank to feed data to and from  Sferyx. This is just clumsy. We need a reasonably good editor, that doesn't have a separate long startup time, complete with equation support, that can appear in multiple text areas on a page. The commercial CMSs' have managed to identify such editors. I'm willing to buy something.</li>

. According to a recent conversation with Chuck, we were given the wrong advice for how best to handle Gradebook permissions in the 2.0 release, and we should have stuck to our original plan, which was just to base authorization on site maintain and access. That could easily be done now if backwards compatibility isn't an issue. See my last comment at:</p>

<p>I'm sorry to sound insistent about this, but the Gradebook application honestly does not store enrollment data anywhere (except in standalone mode, of course). It doesn't store what students are in the course, it doesn't store their names, it doesn't store their email addresses.... All it stores about students is their UIDs in any grade records they've been given. Every time you move to a new screen in the Gradebook, the Gradebook asks Sakai ""Who are the people with gradebook.access permission right here right now?"" and uses that data to display the roster and to figure out whose name belongs to whose grade records.</p>

However, the grade he gave us on the assignment, even though we're no longer in the class, is still being averaged in to calculate the ""Average for Scores Entered"".</p>

<p>I think this is a real scenario at Michigan, since students can add or drop a course until about the 3rd week of classes.

[SAK-2025] Second account using identical e-mail address can block messages,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2025,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>In sites that use the e-mail archive, if you add an account to the participant list and allow messages to be sent, and another account exists that uses the same e-mail address but is not a participant in the site, messages sent by the owner of the first account <b>may</b> fail. It seems like Sakai checks the address to see if it has permission to send messages through that site, and immediately fails on the first ""no"" that it finds. It should check the permissions of all accounts that have that e-mail address, if one of them is allowed to send messages then the message should go through. There is no clear indication of why the message bounces (e-mail error says ""not permitted"" but the archive tool says the address can send messages). </p>

<p>It may seems stupid to have more than one account with the same address, but it's not. We have encouraged faculty to create guest accounts for themselves so they can log into their own course sites with student-level access to check that things look and work correctly. It's very easy and convenient to simply give the same e-mail address for both usernames instead of creating a yahoo or hotmail address, and the system does not prevent it. If this is a ""wontfix"" issue, then a new bug needs to be opened to prevent the same e-mail address from re-used by more than one account.</p>

<p>One approach is consider allowing the same email address for different accounts to be a bug.  Sakai then would then be tasked with validating when an account is created (or when the user changes their email address) that the email address for that account is unique.</p>

<p>A second approach is to have Sakai continue allowing non-unique email addresses for accounts.  The bug then becomes how Sakai handles verfying whether an email should be accepted by Email Archive.  The current logic doesn't appear to know about multiple accounts with the same email address, so depending on which account it runs across first during its check, it will either accept or reject the email; if accepted, then the user probably isn't even aware of the potential problem here.  The question then becomes what logic solves the bug?  Is it that as long as one account with the email address is ""valid"", then the email will be accepted, or is it that as long as one account with the email address is ""invalid"", then the email will be rejected?  </p>

<p>I don't think anyone will ago for the first approach being a real bug, so let's sort of the logic that goes with the second approach.</p>",189164,557058:9cd19dd3-e6f4-4916-9e00-0b7ef570059c,"Wed, 14 Sep 2005 15:03:03 -0400","<p>A third option suggested is to add all accounts with the same email address to the site when you add one.

<p>1. It should be possible to enable enforcing globally unique email addresses (i.e. a sakai.properties option or something that prevents new accounts from being added with the same email address as an existing account, and prevents an account update from creating a duplicate).</p>

<p>2. It should be possible to enforce unique email addresses within a site, possibly on a per-site basis. Sakai would then prevent a user from joining a site if an existing user in that site had the same email address (and would also have to check account updates to ensure that this didn't create conflicts).</p>

<p>In our situation, we would just enforce #1, but in other cases where it's regarded as desirable to allow different users to have the same address, #2 would work around the problem (at the expense of some implementation complexity).</p>

<p>However, in cases where there is no ambiguity (i.e. no 2 users in the site have the same email), the behaviour as described is definitely a clear bug which doesn't require options #1 or #2 above to resolve. Sakai should be able to correctly apply permissions based on site membership.</p>",2.1.0,139260,557058:4391af8f-aa8c-4c73-9de8-3045f273010b,"Fri, 16 Sep 2005 12:44:38 -0400","<p>Option #2 above would not address the problem. The most common scenario for its occurrence is precisely when only one of the two existing accounts is participating in a site. Adding the second account to the site is actually the workaround to the problem, so by preventing that on a site-by-site basis you would block the workaround and leave the original problem. Actually I don't see what benefit there would be to preventing a user from joining a site if an existing user had the same e-mail address - at most it would just prevent the receipt of a second copy of the same e-mail message, and you can already change mail notification preferences to deal with that. </p>

<p>My understanding of the logic<br/>
Sakai receives message, does a search on the ""from"" address, checks if that account exists is permitted to send to the ""to"" address, then either sends or bounces the message. Currently it stops after finding the first account with that address, but should loop for all accounts that have that address. </p>

<p>Or, it should take an entirely different approach, by reversing the query:<br/>
Sakai receives a message, does a search on the ""to"" address (which is the site identifier), checks if the ""from"" address appears in the site participant list for that site and checks the mail archive permissions, and either sends or bounces the message. This way it would not need to know that more than one account has the same address, since it is giving priority to the site settings rather than the account. </p>",172573,557058:d083b1a2-05d0-42f2-a6cc-6f872b5fa30f,"Fri, 16 Sep 2005 12:57:40 -0400","<p>There's the current problem (identified in the description), which Sakai should be able to deal with correctly, i.e. a resolvable bug.</p>

<p>Then there is a range of possible other problems arising from users with the same email. For example, what if user A and user B do both belong to a site, have the same email address, but only user A has rights to send to the mail archive.</p>

<p>Or in the case of a possible future tool which has bidirectional email gateways for discussion forums, you want to associate a message in Sakai that originated in email with the user who sent it. So it's necessary to convert email address &gt; Sakai userid. It should always be possible to resolve this unambiguously, hence the value of not allowing &gt; 1 user in a site with the same email address.</p>",140438,557058:9cd19dd3-e6f4-4916-9e00-0b7ef570059c,"Sat, 29 Oct 2005 09:10:21 -0400","<p>Initial solution for 2.1:  Property flag to select between enable/disable enforcement of the uniqueness of accounts' email addresses.  If being enforced, then each account in Sakai needs to have a unique email address; if not, then multiple Sakai accounts can use the same email address.</p>

<p>When operating in the mode that allows multiple accounts to have the same email address, then each account should be treated as a separate ""individual"".  For instance, one common use-case is an instructor using two accounts in a site to see it from both the instructor and student point-of-view; each account should be handled independently.  In the particular case of the Email Archive &#8211; the focus of this issue &#8211; this means inbound email will be accepted from an address as along as one account with that address has the correct permissions for the site.  A fix is needed, therefore, in how Sakai is checking permissions; the check should not stop after the first occurrence of an email address, unless that account has permission and the email is accepted.</p>",173755,557058:0fb56ab2-a043-427c-ad8c-829b164f7088,"Sat, 29 Oct 2005 09:23:27 -0400","<p>I think the initial solution is to prevent a new account from using an email address that already is used since when that happens email to the site can be rejected when coming from a valid account.

<p>Then the feature requests are the optional flags. We should create new jiras for each of those requests.

<p>I worked on ContentHosting, ResourcesAction, the AccessServlet and <br/>
DavServlet.  ContentHosting methods that access the filesystem will <br/>
throw an exception if<br/>
attempts to access the filesystem fail.  If any other tools are careless about<br/>
the way in which they catch exceptions, it is possible that a failure of this<br/>
sort will be ignored by some other tools.</p>

<p>ASIDE:  Chuck, John Ellis and I talked a lot about this in the past few <br/>
days. John believes very strongly that this kind of exception should be <br/>
handled at<br/>
the highest level possible, probably in the request dispatcher rather than in<br/>
the tool.  He says the request should get redirected to a page reporting a<br/>
general failure that the user cannot correct. The more we talked about it, the<br/>
more I like John's suggestion.  Now is not the right time to do this, but I<br/>
would suggest that after the 2.1 release we back out most of my changes so an<br/>
error writing to the filesystem is again an unchecked exception.  Then we<br/>
should catch java.lang.RuntimeException, java.lang.Error or <br/>
java.lang.Throwable<br/>
in one of the dispatcher classes (VPPA or above) and redirect from <br/>
there for any<br/>
kind of catastrophic failure like this.</p>",193278,6164e404c669a60069cbbb37,"Tue, 24 Jan 2006 16:55:32 -0500","<p>Due to insufficiant QA resources, this issue was not verified via the formal QA process but is included (ie fixed) in a production version of Sakai (2.1).

[SAK-2015] Foreign Character Encoding Issue,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-2015,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Below are our notes on research an ongoing Unicode issue.</p>

<p>Discovered in Assignments and Resources<br/>
Manifestation - Assignments:</p>
<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>If a user creates an assignment with a Unicode character in the Title field, the assignment does not show up in the list of assignments</li>
	<li>The catalina.out log reveals a XML parsing error.</li>
	<li>The MySQL database field contains an incomplete XML file that ends at the point where the Unicode character was found.</li>
</ul>


<p>Manifestation - Resources:</p>
<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>If a file upload contains a foreign character in the file name, the Resources tool may become unstable throughout the system and be unavailable to all sites.</li>
</ul>


<p>Comments</p>
<ul class=""alternate"" type=""square"">
	<li>When the form used by the ""New Assignment"" page is processed, it generates an entire XML file and stores it in the database.</li>

<p>""the Resources tool may become unstable throughout the system and be unavailable to all sites.""</p>

<p>This to us seems the most severe aspect of this bug.  Once the errors are kicked off, they loop around indefinitely until Tomcat is restarted, and with each loop they write another bad row to the CONTENT_RESOURCE table.  Over the course of a weekend this once filled an entire tablespace, and effectively crashed the system.  The only symptom the user sees is that the Resources tool hangs, but underneath the hood Sakai is spinning in circles until someone forcibly stops it.</p>

<p>Our emergency response as soon as we see this beginning is to kill the process trying to do inserts into the table, and then truncate the table to remove all the bad rows.

<p>I just checked version 2.1.0_005 and this issue is better, but still not completely fixed; at least it did not take down Sakai. As the attached screen image will show, the Title of an assignment is mangled; for comparison, the title should be the same as is shown in the assignment body.</p>

<p>A separate, but related additional note: in another test, I have foreign characters in the title of a MS Word document I uploaded as an assignment attachment. When the title was stored in the database, the foreign characters were replaced by regular characters. That is, ""Fore<span class=""error"">&#91;accent grave&#93;</span>ign Do<span class=""error"">&#91;accent acute&#93;</span>cument.doc"" is in the database as ""Foregin Document.doc.""</p>

<p>Hope this is clear and makes sense.</p>

<p>The graphic posted today by James Williamson relates to the character encoding of the title of an assignment.  I'm not sure whether that was the original issue in this ticket, but at this point it seems like either there should be a new ticket for that issue or this ticket should be revised to cover it.  I think the part of this ticket related to resources has been resolved.  As James notes, characters in the name of an uploaded file that are invalid in a resource id are escaped in the resource id so, for example, ""Fore<span class=""error"">&#91;accent grave&#93;</span>ign Do<span class=""error"">&#91;accent acute&#93;</span>cument.doc"" becomes ""Foreign Document.doc"" in the resource id, but I think you'll find that the original is preserved as the title in resources.  Maybe the same approach could be used in assignments?  Or maybe that's just a matter of making sure that UTF-8 is used in every step of the processing of the title?</p>

<p>Could you assign this ticket to someone who can fix this in assignments?  </p>

<p>This is <b>NOT</b> how Sakai's volume management works.  It does not ""roll over"" from one to the other.  Instead, if randomly assigns new files to one of the set of volumes (I'd have to look up what ""random"" means here).  If a volume is full, it's full, and you have a problem.</p>

<p>Look to see if the distribution of files over these 2 volumes is a) occurring (you should see an even mix of resources with these two in their file_path fields in content_resource) and b) even.  Let me know what you see.</p>

<p>We've run this with 99 volumes, which is a much larger number than 2.  Perhaps the ""random"" distribution is not working with 2 all that well.  Our 100 are really mapped to just one or two afs volumes.  The idea is that if things start to fill up, we would get a new AFS volume, move some files around (their paths would not change, just how the 99 volumes are mapped to the real disks), and therefore have more room.</p>

The r1635 changes bring the various providers up to the new API, but you may not need these if you are not using them.</p>

<p>Then make sure to update your custom UserDirectoryProvider to add the new method.</p>

<p>The new API is:</p>

<p>    /**</p>
<ul>
	<li>Access a collection of UserEdit objects; if the user is found, update the information, otherwise remove the UserEdit object from the collection.</li>
	<li>@param users The UserEdit objects (with id set) to fill in or remove.<br/>
     */<br/>
    void getUsers(Collection users);</li>
</ul>


<p>Following the pattern of the UserDirectoryProvider's getUser(UserEdit) method, a Collection of UserEdit objects is passed in, with only the id fields filled in.  The provider must either fill in the rest of the information, just like for getUser(), or remove it from the collection.  Only found users with information filled in should be returned.  If none of the users are found, return an empty collection..</p>

<p>If your implementation supports some efficient way to check and get the info of many users at once, then implement this method to take advantage of this.</p>

<p>If not, simply do something like this:</p>

<p>    /**</p>
<ul>
	<li>Access a collection of UserEdit objects; if the user is found, update the information, otherwise remove the UserEdit object from the collection.</li>
	<li>@param users The UserEdit objects (with id set) to fill in or remove.<br/>

[SAK-34648] sam 517 is not a non-issue: import/export of random draw from pool,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/browse/SAK-34648,10057,SAK,Sakai,"<p>517 was answered as a non-issue. It's not. I have a faculty member who has 29 sections of a 1000 person course. He has prepared a test in a test area using a bunch of random draw from pool. He now needs to put the assessment into the 29 sections. He was expecting to export it and import it into the 29 sections. He's about the get a very nasty surprise.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what happens when we need to move an assessment from one course to another? <b>EVERY</b> object in the system has to be exportable and moveable.</p>

<p>1) The pools themselves need to be exportable and importable, so we can pass responsbility to another faculty member, among other things.</p>

<p>2) The questions using the pools need to be.</p>

<p>The original 517 answer said basically that it was a hard problem. I'm willing to accept a subset.

<p>Some good news is that I have versions of 'Import Question Pool' working for locally for me in both Sakai v2.1 and 2.2.x. Both code sets are pending review and QA before they can be moved to trunk or maintenance, however. I cannot give you a release estimate yet.</p>

<p>This new feature will not resolve your original problem because as you've stated, exporting an assessment with any question pool random draw results in the entire pool of questions being exported within the assessment. This will also be an issue for site archival from one quarter/semester to another. The solution might require a new item/question type in the qti code that specifies the random draw and pool information.  I'll include this concept in my QTI studies to see if there is an existing model in the documentation.</p>

<p>One advantage of the current design is that I have been able to export an assessment with random draw from one user's pool and import that xml file as a question pool for another user. So question pool sharing will be available between user's with this technique when the import code is released.</p>

<p>The export question pool issue is bigger because of the possibility of multiple levels of subpools. We need to determine the best model for handling this issue prior to coding.

<p>Also it is standard procedure to approach coding practice and refactoring that does not expose a user-facing defect as a task rather than a bug.</p>

<p>Here are some of the possible candidate interpretations:</p>

<p>1. Java ServerFaces rendered attributes are using more complex EL logical expressions, and that calculated boolean backing bean properties might make more readable code.  </p>

<p>2. Java ServerFaces urls are independent of the actual page being displayed.  Although there some approaches to coding around it, generally speaking JSF is a post-centric UI framework, and hides the underlying code that apage represents.</p>

<p>3. The Java code needs to use enumerated types or bitmasks.  I completely understand the comment, but have no idea what this means in practical terms.</p>

<p>I can find cases for all three interpretations. </p>

On the other hand, scores for individual questions do not show after grading when a student goes back to look at their test. One could argue for separate settings for total score and scores of individual items (or perhaps showing individual item scores only if question-level feedback is turned on), but we think faculty are most likely to want this to show. After all, most faculty turn back paper tests, and students expect to see what they did on each question. One could turn on showing correct answer, but that doesn't deal with knowing how much partial credit you got on each question.<br/>

<p>He's running into all kinds of problems.</p>

<p>2. Feedback is pretty much binary. If you set immediate feedback, they can get feedback while taking the test. We all find this very odd. We'd expect to see feedback only after they submit it for grading, at least as an option. I'd be willing to argue that this is a bug. Someone might want the current behavior, but I think it would be unusual.</p>

(""Show Feedback"" should not be displayed in this case before submission for grading).  The feedback shown to the user should only include that associated with the selections made.  This should be true for both MC/Single Correct Answer and MC/Multiple Correct Answer</p>

<p>2) For dated Feedback for a test it should work as it does now.  No students can see how they did until the feedback date arrives.</p>

<p>3) For self-study/Immediate Feedback:  it may be helpful for a student to work on a single question until they get a correct answer but this will essentially invalidate any saved score since they can iterate on selection/Show Feedback until they find the right one.

<p>I checked that there is setting for highest / average score in assessment setting but I don't think it has been implemented at all.</p>

<p>1. in select assessment page, u have a list of submitted assessment, the score recorded what you have last submitted but not any highest nor average.</p>

<p>2. In the grading page, the grade again can show the last assessment score that you have submitted or all that you have submitted but there is no place for highest or average score.</p>

<p>3. GB basically provides a view to the last assessment that you have submitted like 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>Found by Lydia.  The Question Scores and Statistics screens in grading sometimes refer to the wrong assessment.</p>

<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>

<p>1) Make sure you have at least one published assessment with real submissions (at least one person took the assessment, answered at least some of the questions, and submitted for grading.)</p>

<p>2) Publish a new assessment to anonymous users.</p>

<p>3) Take the assessment via the published url but do NOT answer any questions.  Submit the empty assessment for grading.</p>

<p>5) Go back to the main authoring page.  Click on the ""Scores"" link for the new anonymous assessment (the one created in step 2.)</p>

<p>6) You'll see the total score page for that assessment.  There should be no links to question scores or statistics on this screen, because no questions were answered and there's no data to display.   </p>

<p>7) Go back to the main authoring page and this time click on the ""Scores"" link for the first assessment (mentioned in step 1).  Look at the total scores, the question scores and the statistics screens.</p>

<p>8) Go back to the main authoring page and click the ""Scores"" link for the anonymous assessment again (the one created in step 2).  Now it has a question scores link and a statistics link!</p>

<p>9) When you click on these links,  either Sakai throws an ""unable to call QuestionScores"" exception, or it displays the question scores page for the first assessment (the one from step 1).   You can see the wrong name at the top of the page.</p>

<p>catalina.out log entries are attached. (but not the exception - I can try and reproduce that again if you need it.)</p>",WINXP IE,37701,SAK-1995,question scores/stats mixups,10007,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype,Bug,10002,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.svg,Major,6,https://sakaiproject.atlassian.net/images/icons/statuses/closed.png,"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

<p>When you view assessment questions in authoring, random draw parts are displayed with the following warning (see screenshot):</p>

<p>""This assessment contains a random draw part, the ""total points"" is an estimate.""</p>


<p>Two problems with this warning:</p>

<p>1) It's ungrammatical.  How about rephrasing it to say something like:</p>

<p>""Because this assessment contains a random draw part, the ""total points"" information is only an estimate.""</p>

<p>2)  Below the part name is not a good place for it.

<p>Turns out there is an item description field.  This is displayed in the delivery UI.  Trouble is, it was never set in authoring, but it was in import.</p>

<p>So<br/>
a. the UI should have had whitespace if we used this field.<br/>
b. import and authoring should treat this consistently</p>

<p>Now, there is a purpose in setting the imported question title string as a question description, because not all other QTI applications set the title to the item type, so this data would be displayed.  </p>

<p>This is a nitpicky detail we can work out later.  For now, I have commented out the field.</p>
