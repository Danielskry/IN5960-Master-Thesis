Suspect this one may be highly sporadic.;;;","Feb 14 2016 10:52:16 PM UTC;alexander.gorrod;[~david.hows] Can you dig into the test case itself, to try to understand how it could fail. With the goal of deciding whether this is a bug in the test or WiredTiger.

Then start making tweaks to the test case and the test environment (CPU availability, disk speed etc) so that it's more likely to fail. If you can't get it to fail by changing the test case start digging into the compact implementation inside WiredTiger.;;;","Feb 17 2016 02:45:27 AM UTC;david.hows;I have done some reproduction and dived into what may be the cause here. I'm not sure if this is a test issue or a WT issue, but am leaning towards test at this stage.

When this issue triggers, it appears that there is a large amount of leftover free space within the tables data file (see below). In the below case you can see that there is a spare 30MB of data for reuse, this data causes the files to be too big, thus firing the assertion in the test. From a tree perspective the two data sets are mostly similar with

*Good*
{code}
block-manager: checkpoint size=45M (45219840)
block-manager: file bytes available for reuse=9M (9711616)
block-manager: file size in bytes=54M (54890496)

*Bad*
{code}
block-manager: checkpoint size=45M (45207552)
block-manager: file bytes available for reuse=37M (37154816)
block-manager: file size in bytes=82M (82333696)
{code};;;","Feb 17 2016 03:10:23 AM UTC;alexander.gorrod;[~david.hows] What the statistics you report above means is that there is a block towards the end of the file that is stopping WiredTiger from being able to reclaim the empty space. How compact works in WiredTiger is to keep creating new checkpoints using a first-fit algorithm - each checkpoint should move content that is towards the end of the file to the beginning. Each time a checkpoint finishes, if there is empty space at the end we truncate to the last non-empty block.

What we need to understand with the test failure is why compact isn't reclaiming space occasionally. It is likely due to how the content of the file is created before the compact is run. Have you found a way to reproduce the test failure outside of Jenkins? If so it would be valuable to alter the test so that it saves a copy of the database before it runs compact. If we can get a database like that, and compare it to one that does compact successfully, it should be simpler to analyze the failure.;;;","Feb 17 2016 06:04:16 AM UTC;david.hows;After some confiuration, I ran this through a number of iterations under both limited CPU (10% of 1 core) and under a highly constrained disk setup (1MB/s symmetrical throughput) and didn't reproduce it. Will be diving further into the compact code to see if I can find a way to trigger this more reliably.;;;","Feb 19 2016 02:28:39 AM UTC;david.hows;I was able to get a quite quick reproduction of this issue by running the 128KB page size test instead of just the 8 and 32K page tests.

With this, I found that sporadically, we would walk a tree but never move any pages when there was very much space to move pages into.

Looking at the test for it is doing, there are occasions where the review of pages can skip over every page in the given 10% of the file we are reviewing. Meaning, there is space - but we don't want to move any of the chunks for some reason. As a high level test, I added an extra ""retry last"" step, where we give the compact of the final 10% one more go and see if we can move anything. This looked to solve the issue, but I believe there is a need to understand why we would skip all pages of a potentially moveable chunk.;;;","Feb 19 2016 02:54:08 AM UTC;alexander.gorrod;Thanks for the description [~david.hows].

bq. the review of pages can skip over every page in the given 10% of the file

Can you explain why the pages are being skipped?;;;","Feb 19 2016 03:39:51 AM UTC;david.hows;Looking at the pages involved, we skip them because compaction believes that no pages are within the last 20% of the file?!

This either means we are unable to see some subset of pages (this seems unlikely) or that we have an invalid calculation as to the current file size. Looking at the verbose checkpoint output, the latter looks plausible (see below). Below the compact outputs are in pairs (one for start and end each lap of compact), initially, each lap looks to shrink the file somewhat and reclaim space as we compact. However, while the latter pairs are moving pages we are no longer saving space. And thus, truncate very little.

Message: WT-2969 Possible snapshot corruption during compaction (#3160)

* Change compaction to use database-wide checkpoints: rather than processing each file separately and checkpointing after each time we compact a file, do a compaction pass over all of the files then database-wide checkpoints.

* Save/restore the WT_SESSION_CAN_WAIT, WT_SESSION_NO_EVICTION flags set during checkpoint, the session handle may be used for other tasks in the future.

* There's no need to hold the checkpoint lock while opening the metadata cursor.

* When adc1cfb went in (WT-2394, gather handles for compaction first, before doing the actual compaction), we broke data-source support for compaction. Add back in data-source support and simplify the __wt_schema_worker() code, it no longer needs to know about LSM or data-source compaction.

* Disallow LSM compaction in an existing transaction (LSM didn't check, but there's no reason to special case LSM compaction so it can run in an existing transaction, and it's potentially confusing, or fragile if LSM compaction some day requires checkpoints).

* Do a checkpoint after removing the key/value pairs, otherwise we might not find anything to work with in our compaction pass.

* Replace WT_SESSION_LOCK_NO_WAIT with per-lock operation flags. If we set WT_SESSION_LOCK_NO_WAIT and the lock is acquired, then the underlying operation eventually needs to acquire its own locks, having the WT_SESSION_LOCK_NO_WAIT flag set in the session may not be correct.

change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,

My last commit introduced a bug, letting the event handler go out of

from the main function, that way we don't have to play games to get the
CUSTOM_EVENT_HANDLER declaration next to the code that initializes it.

This is a side-effect of the fact that WT_CURSOR.insert doesn't ""position"" the cursor, which is the action that changes the cursor to reference in-database key/value memory, rather than application key/value memory.

This potentially leads to a core dump in this sequence:
{noformat}
WT_CURSOR.set_key
WT_CURSOR.set_value
WT_CURSOR.insert
free set-key memory
WT_CURSOR.search
{noformat}

It's a wildly unlikely application pattern, but still an odd corner case.

Decision was to change WT_CURSOR.insert to unset the key/value after the insert, so the update in the above example would fail naturally because there's no key/value set.",,,,,,,,,,,,SERVER-21349,SERVER-21549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-11-16 11:42:56.0,191721600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,jocelyn.del-prado(jocelyn.del-prado),Thu Nov 19 14:42:00 UTC 2015,,,,,,,,,,xgen-internal-githook(xgen-internal-githook),keith.bostic(keith.bostic),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hrt373:,,,,,,0|i1bss7:,"9,22337203685478E+018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hriy1j:,"Nov 16 2015 11:42:56 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'keithbostic', u'name': u'Keith Bostic', u'email': u'keith@wiredtiger.com'}

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

SERVER-23659  Provide useful message when wiredTigerJournalCompressor is changed
SERVER-23661  $sample takes disproportionately long time on newly created collection

Message: Import wiredtiger-wiredtiger-2.8.0-592-g848e5f5.tar.gz from wiredtiger branch mongodb-3.2

ref: 8b7110b..848e5f5
for: 3.2.9

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

Message: WT-2820 add gcc warn_unused_result attribute (#2938)

* Add the gcc ""cold"" attribute to the verbose, message, and assorted error functions (informs the compiler that the function is unlikely to be executed).

* Add the WT_IGNORE_RET() macro that ignores return values in the handfull of places we want to ignore return values.

* Replace calls to fprintf() in the utility with calls to util_err(), replace local variable names in error messages with class names.

{{test_wt2719_reconfig}} is the test where we throw random configuration and re-configuration stuff at a WiredTiger database, and there's a 60-second timer so we catch hangs and get a core dump.

My guess is that valgrind slowed things down enough that we crossed the 60-second timer, but we should look through the core.

If there's no evidence of a real failure, we should increase the timer so valgrind doesn't hit it.

Here are the stacks:

{noformat}
#0  __evict_tune_workers (session=0x5837690) at ../src/evict/evict_lru.c:1001
{noformat}

That is executing this loop:

{code}
 998                 /* Reduce the number of eviction workers to the minimum */
 999                 thread_surplus = conn->evict_threads.current_threads -
1000                     conn->evict_threads_min;
1001                 for (i = 0; i < thread_surplus; i++) {
1002                         __wt_thread_group_stop_one(
1003                             session, &conn->evict_threads);

1006                 }
{code}

And unfortunately we've had underflow in the unsigned integer calculation:

Something I've been interested in a number of times is knowing how much I/O is done in service of checkpoints versus ""normal"" eviction. I've always chickened out, since the information isn't available down in __wt_block_write_off where we know how much is being written. The checkpoint I/O smoothing project (WT-2389) would be easier to handle if we tracked the information, so I took a look today.

How would you feel if I made a change to __wt_block_write so that it takes a set of flags, rather than a bool. At the moment those flags would be:
WT_BLOCK_WRITE_CKSUM
WT_BLOCK_WRITE_CALLER_LOCKED
WT_BLOCK_WRITE_FOR_CHECKPOINT

I'd also need to pass a flag from __sync_file through reconciliation, indicating that the operation is being done in service of a checkpoint.

There are other alternatives. For example we could add a check for a (new) checkpointing flag in a session handle down in the block manager.

(I'm not saying we shouldn't do it, just that it's going to make the layering worse to do it in the block manager.)

Maybe we could do it in bt_io.c:__wt_bt_write() (that's the Btree function that calls __wt_block_write()).
 
Maybe __sync_file doesn't need a new flag: we could use the existing WT_SESSION flag WT_SESSION_LOCKED_CHECKPOINT flag. (That wouldn't work if we had more than one thread doing checkpoints though.)

Reconciliation has the WT_EVICTING flag set when it's called to do eviction, isn't everything else a checkpoint?

Based on a few minutes of thought, I'd try passing the WT_EVICTING flag from reconciliation to __wt_bt_write() and it would update the appropriate statistics before it returns.

I'll push a branch for us to talk about.;;;","Jul 07 2016 04:49:25 AM UTC;alexander.gorrod;On the pull request we have been having a conversation about why it is interesting to see statistics from the block manager, and not just the cache management layer. I've pulled together a graph showing {{block manager}} vs {{cache}} vs {{cache for checkpoint}} bytes written. It can be seen that there is a correlation between block manager and cache, but it isn't easily inferable, and can vary. It is useful to track both of those metrics, and it would be useful to track both with relation to data written for checkpoint as well.

In the pull request [~keith.bostic] you said:

bq. Regardless, we can know the disk-block write size in bt_io.c (and in fact, we have to figure it out there, for compressed and encrypted blocks), that's what the bm->write_size() call does.

I don't believe that's true. That will tell us rounding to block size, but won't tell us how compressed the data is.

I generated the above graph from statistics generated running the following wtperf workload:

{code}
# wtperf options file: Stress checkpoint data volume
conn_config=""cache_size=10GB,log=(enabled=false),checkpoint=(wait=60),statistics=[fast,clear],statistics_log=(wait=1)""
table_config=""leaf_page_max=32k,internal_page_max=16k,allocation_size=4k,split_pct=90,type=file""
# Enough data to fill the cache. 100 million 1k records results in two ~6GB tables

# there is more than a single table.

bq. That will tell us rounding to block size, but won't tell us how compressed the data is.

I'm sorry, but I'm just missing something obvious, let's talk this through the next time we're both on-line.

My understanding is that in {{bt_io.c:\_\_wt_bt_write()}}, we have {{WT_ITEM.size}} which is the unaligned number of bytes to write. That WT_ITEM is passed to {{block_write.c:\_\_wt_block_write_off()}}, which writes the header into the buffer, aligns to the block allocation size, clears any unused bytes, checksums and writes the block. 

I had not thought you might want to compare against the system's iostat numbers, that makes sense to me and argues for I/O based numbers. We could track {{WT_ITEM.size}} (aligned to the block-allocation size) in {{bt_io.c:\_\_wt_bt_write()}}, I expect that to track with the iostat values.;;;","Jul 07 2016 03:18:31 PM UTC;keith.bostic;And, all that said, I went ahead and drilled the holes into the block manager so it knows which I/Os are in service of checkpoint.

That way we get slightly more accurate numbers, we don't violate layering by making alignment checks in the Btree layer, and it will work if/when we want to tune a pluggable filesystem.;;;","Jul 08 2016 02:10:20 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'keithbostic', u'name': u'Keith Bostic', u'email': u'keith.bostic@mongodb.com'}

WT_PM_REC_REWRITE cleanup,WT-2108,229760,,Bug,Closed,WT,WiredTiger,software,backlog-server-storage-engines,"<p>Issues relating to the WiredTiger storage engine, independent of MongoDB.</p>

<p>If you have an issue with MongoDB running on WiredTiger, please open a <a href=""/browse/SERVER"">SERVER</a> ticket.</p>",https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger,Minor - P4,Fixed,keith.bostic,keith.bostic,keith.bostic,Sep 15 2015 10:37:51 AM UTC,Oct 12 2017 11:15:08 PM UTC,Dec 17 2021 05:33:26 AM UTC,Oct 12 2015 12:46:36 PM UTC,,,,WT2.7.0,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,"Reference WT-1919.

{{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}} is a short-lived page state set in one specific path, when forced eviction of a leaf page fails because there's nothing much to write. The fact it must be a leaf page during eviction is because it is only set in a reconciliation call where {{WT_EVICT_UPDATE_RESTORE}} was set. It's short-lived because before we give up the exclusive lock on the page, we create a new page and swap it into place, and discard the page where {{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}} was set.

For these reasons...

{{sync_file}} (the {{WT_SYNC_CHECKPOINT}} operation) should not be checking for {{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}}, it should never see that flag as the checkpoint will be blocked from the leaf page until the eviction is complete.

{{rec_root_write}} should not be checking for {{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}}, it should never see that flag because it's writing internal pages, not leaf pages (and it's not evicting, anyway).

{{rec_col_int}} should not be checking for {{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}}, because any write of a page's column-store internal page parent will be blocked from evaluating the leaf child until the eviction is complete.

{{rec_write_wrapup}} should not be checking for {{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}}, because any previous reconciliation that set {{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}} will have cleared that flag before this reconciliation could proceed.

{{rec_write_wrapup_err}} should not be checking for {{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}} because it's only set when a reconciliation is already considered successful.

This pretty much removes the need for the {{WT_PM_REC_REWRITE}} state -- the additional error handling makes me think we'd be better off getting rid of it and using {{WT_PM_REC_MULTIBLOCK}} with a single test, if we ended up with 1 block or several blocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,SERVER-20771,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-10-12 01:25:28.0,195091200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,jocelyn.del-prado(jocelyn.del-prado),Mon Oct 12 01:25:35 UTC 2015,,,,,,,,,,xgen-internal-githook(xgen-internal-githook),keith.bostic(keith.bostic),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hrt3yf:,,,,,,0|i1aht3:,"9,22337203685478E+018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hslbif:,"Sep 15 2015 12:13:02 PM UTC;keith.bostic;[~michael.cahill], I've pushed a set of changes for this (mostly reverting the changes for WT-1919, and with a different fix for the problem that WT-1919 was chasing).

I still don't understand how it was possible for us to get into the state WT-1919 described: the ""in-memory rewrite"" page state should be replaced by a new {{WT_REF_MEM}} page where {{WT_PM_REC_MULTIBLOCK}} isn't set before the exclusive eviction lock is released, and with an impossibly low {{first_dirty_txn}} value to ensure the page is written, besides. All this can only happen if the page is dirty, of course, so the usual checkpoint/eviction dirty-page lockout is in force.

Maybe the tree was different when WT-1919 went in, but I've done a spot check of the places I'd expect a problem, and it looks correct to me. Anyway, in summary, there's still some stuff here that needs an explanation, and I'm hoping you remember!

Regardless, I think this change is a better fix for WT-1919, it removes a bunch of special-purpose code and ensures if this path is possible, the replacement blocks we create are consistent and correct for a merge into the parent page.;;;","Oct 12 2015 01:25:28 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'keithbostic', u'name': u'Keith Bostic', u'email': u'keith@wiredtiger.com'}

Message: WT-1919, WT-2108: The code to create the information for an rewrite of
a single block in memory wasn't setting the multiblock key; should its
parent page somehow be written before the leaf page is rewritten and
attempt to merge the child page's information into the parent, we could
drop core. I still don't see the path where that's possible in the
current system, but it's the right thing to do regardless, the block
should always be consistent.

To summarize here my biggest concerns are that there are multiple places we set the current eviction queue, and I think, results in incorrect stats.  And having 3 pointers in the {{cache}} structure pointing to two different queues at various points in time is confusing.  In any case, any follow-on discussion or changes should go to this ticket.;;;","Aug 30 2016 11:33:56 PM UTC;michael.cahill;[~keith.bostic] and [~sue.loverso] also point out that the barrier in {{\_\_wt_evict_file_exclusive_on}} is not required:

         * this point.

The problem is that the eviction server switches nearly immediately to stuck mode, and doesn't even attempt to evict any pages. It keeps repopulating the queue, but there is not enough content in cache for application threads to being contributing to eviction.

Eviction shouldn't get into stuck mode unless the cache is completely full, so I'll make that change and it will resolve the test failure. However that will just mask another bug:

Once the cache is in stuck mode, the cache-full check fires in {{__wt_cache_eviction_worker}}, triggering a {{WT_ROLLBACK}} for the only operation currently running. There is a problem in the current complex-table code where that {{WT_ROLLBACK}} is being swallowed, and the cursor is being left in a state where the primary has key set, but the other column group cursors don't. I *think* what is happening is that we are retrying the insert, but it's failing because the {{WT_CURSTD_KEY_SET}} flag has been cleared.

It is possible, but I think the root cause there is the new default for {{eviction_dirty_target}}, which means that there is a lower upper bound on dirty pages. There is some (quite complex) logic in test/format to calculate a reasonable {{memory_page_max}} for the workload - I believe that needs to be adjusted to take into account the new default {{eviction_dirty_target}}.;;;","Sep 08 2016 07:35:42 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'michaelcahill', u'name': u'Michael Cahill', u'email': u'michael.cahill@mongodb.com'}

1. Build as follows with a large timestamp (say with timestamp size 16):
{noformat}
CFLAGS=""-ggdb"" ../configure --enable-python --enable-strict --enable-diagnostic --enable-verbose --disable-static --with-timestamp-size=16; make -j20
{noformat}

2. Run the python test {{test_timestamp01}}:

The following portion of the test fails:

{noformat}
        # Too big is also not permitted

                '/too long/') 
{noformat}

With 16 bit timestamp size, 1 << 100 is not too long. The test should look at {{WT_TIMESTAMP_SIZE}} when deciding what is too long.

In the current implementation of how statistics are maintained:
* We have only one category of statistics, ie ""fast"".
* The stats that are collected on top of fast in the statistics cursor context are not updated and maintained the way fast stats are. They are collected when asked for by walking the btree.
* There is another set of statistics that is not separately maintained, but copied to the stats cursor when required through WT_STAT_SET. Though these are categorised as fast statistics, FAST macros are not used on them.

Current implementation in the process of providing the ability to have categories causes confusion, while we don't even have a second category at the moment.

It is hard to tell which statistic is to be classified as ""fast"" and which other as ""all-only"". An end user for WiredTiger has a real interest in knowing which falls under which category.
This classification is not easy to make today and requires not just understanding the implementation, but also scanning throughout the code to locate all the instances where these stats get updated.
Also, nothing prevents a particular statistic from being updated through both WT_STAT_SET and FAST macros at different places in the code.

Recently we annotated all statistics in stat_data.py which are not updated in fast mode with an ""all-only"" flag (WT-2221). This gets used to auto generate information for the user on which statistics are not covered under ""fast"".
I found it very confusing and practically impossible through a script to figure out which statistics are ""fast"" and which aren't.
The implementation through macros should have been simple enough that a script can read through the code and classify based on the macro used. Though the current implementation gives out that impression, it is not the case today.

I believe if we extend the existing code to add more categories in the future, though functionally it will work, it has potential to cause more confusion and maintenance difficulties.

An ideal implementation that supports several categories will hide the part where it determines which category a particular stat falls under and whether or not current configuration calls for an update to the said statistic.
This portion of the code that manages category and configuration for a statistic could also be auto-generated from the category-annotations in stat_data.py.
It will present a uniform set of macros/API for all the stats to be updated (set, increment, decrement, etc), thus simplifying the code.
While using these macros to update a particular statistic I should not have to worry about which category and what configuration holds good with this statistic.

I believe that the change under review doesn't really do away with categories in a functional sense, but simplifies the code and gives a uniform interface to operate on all the statistics.
Once needed to add more categories, there will be work involved either with the current code or with the change I have made. I think it will be towards a cleaner interface if on top of this change.;;;","Sep 08 2016 03:32:44 PM UTC;keith.bostic;bq. There is another set of statistics that is not separately maintained, but copied to the stats cursor when required through WT_STAT_SET. Though these are categorised as fast statistics, FAST macros are not used on them

Thinking about this a bit with Alex, here's what I think happened:

\\
* The reason to test {{FAST}}) was to avoid statistics updates in performance paths,
* Once statistics are being collected for return to the user we are by definition not in a performance path,
* I never thought it would be a problem if we returned too many statistics to the application,
* So, in the ""collect the statistics"" code, I used the {{WT_STAT_XX}} macros instead a {{FAST}} variant.

I think that reasoning is correct, but I also agree it's confusing when the code doesn't test {{FAST}}, but still returns a statistic.

I'm pretty sure the only difference between {{all}} and {{fast}} at the moment is the table-stats in {{btree/bt_stat.c}}.

I agree with [~sulabh.mahajan]'s comments on this leading to difficulties in auto-generating documentation and/or validating the code.;;;","Sep 08 2016 03:52:49 PM UTC;keith.bostic;I think the open question is if we want to preserve the ability to add new groups of statistics in the future.

If we don't care about adding statistics groups (or, at least, think more groups are sufficiently unlikely and not worth worrying about), then I think we should merge [~sulabh.mahajan]'s change as written.

If-and-only-if we do care about adding statistics groups in the future, then I think the current branch moves away from that goal.

[~sulabh.mahajan], what do you think about this:

\\
* add a new set of statistics {{ALL}} macros, like {{FAST}}, that check {{WT_STAT_ENABLED}},
* change the existing uses of {{WT_STAT_XX}} in the code to check either {{FAST}} or {{ALL}} when updating a field,
* add a script to confirm we don't use {{WT_STAT_XX}} anywhere in the code (they're now only used by {{FAST/ALL}} macros),

bq. if we do care about adding statistics groups in the future, then I think the current branch moves away from that goal.

I disagree, I actually think we can make adding new groups more user-friendly if we start from the code as is in the branch [~sulabh.mahajan] pushed up. I'll lay out how I think it would work to add a new category:

We would annotate the category for a statistic in the {{stat_data.py}} definition, similar to the new {{fast}} tag. We could then implement a scheme within macros so that category checking is hidden from code inside WiredTiger that is bumping counters. I'll try to put together an example: Let's say we want to add a new {{spinlocks}} category. The statistic declaration would go something like:

{code}

Then we auto generate some *magic* macros that only gather the stat if the spin category is enabled. I don't have an implementation of that in my head, but maybe something like:

{code}
/* Code auto-generated by stat.py, do not edit directly */
#define WT_STAT_CONN_INCR(s, name)                                                        \

         etc...
{code}

That keeps all of the logic about statistics categories out of regular WiredTiger code, so we wouldn't need a script to check that the categories lined up with expectations.;;;","Sep 09 2016 03:23:35 PM UTC;keith.bostic;[~alexander.gorrod], that makes sense to me, I like that solution.

One thing, I don't see how the switch statement works.

First, ""name"" is currently a structure field name (which we could change), second, it's going to be a huge jump table (or if/else branches), for big categories, we won't want to add it in performance paths.

What about an inlined function per statistic:
{noformat}
static inline void
__wt_stat_incr_spinlock(WT_SESSION_IMPL *session)
{
        if (FLD_ISSET(S2C(session)->stat_flags, WT_STAT_SPINLOCK_STATS))
                WT_STAT_INTERNAL_INCR(session, S2C(session)->stats, spinlocks));
}
{noformat}

The code calls its function.

We have like 15 places we use DECR and ATOMIC statistic macros which makes this messier, we have to figure out how to generate functions for those variants...

Regardless, lgtm.

[~sue.loverso]?;;;","Sep 09 2016 05:59:00 PM UTC;sue.loverso;I like [~alexander.gorrod]'s description as that makes a lot of sense to me.  Thanks for your description and example as it helped this become clearer.

I took a quick pass in the current code at how we'd add a category like {{cache}} and how easy it would really be.  There are some drawbacks that make moving in this direction, as described, better.  
* having the generic macro and hiding the category behind the {{dist/stat_data.py}} definition is good.
* there are assumptions in the code that a stat belongs to a single category only.
* there is code that only allows a single category to be configured at a time (with the exception of {{all}}).  So, if we added {{cache}} a user couldn't configure {{fast}} also.
* and you're right that we need to know and add macros for the correct category and need to verify the right stats/macros are being used.

What we do want is the ability to specify multiple categories for a single stat.  For instance, with {{statistics=(cache)}} we'd want the ""extra"" new cache-only stats to only be collected.  But also, we want to allow existing {{fast}} cache-related stats to be collected.  We want to allow multiple categories like {{statistics=(fast,cache)}} or {{statistics=(cache,spinlock)}}.

Having a cache-related stat that is desired both in {{fast}} and {{cache}} would explode the current code macros such as WT_STAT_CONN_FAST_CACHE_INCR and gets very ugly very fast.

I haven't thought about how we get there but I can definitely buy into the single macro in the code and working behind with the specification file.  Requirements are ease of definition in {{dist/stat_data.py}}, auto-generating the behind-the-scenes macro/inline function/whatever, auto-generating documentation.;;;","Sep 14 2016 03:20:14 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'sulabhM', u'name': u'Sulabh Mahajan', u'email': u'sulabh.mahajan@mongodb.com'}

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

Simplify aggregation of statistics,WT-2060,227085,,Improvement,Closed,WT,WiredTiger,software,backlog-server-storage-engines,"<p>Issues relating to the WiredTiger storage engine, independent of MongoDB.</p>

<p>If you have an issue with MongoDB running on WiredTiger, please open a <a href=""/browse/SERVER"">SERVER</a> ticket.</p>",https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger,Minor - P4,Fixed,keith.bostic,keith.bostic,michael.cahill,Aug 25 2015 11:26:25 PM UTC,Oct 12 2017 11:14:36 PM UTC,Dec 17 2021 05:33:26 AM UTC,Dec 11 2015 11:40:12 AM UTC,,,,WT2.8.0,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,"1. We don't need no_aggregate any more, max_aggregate is just as good.

  The current {{no_aggregate}} statistics are: file allocation size, file magic number, file major/minor version, and file column-store fixed-record length, and the maximum value is at least as good as the last one we find (and in some cases, such as the file allocation size, arguably better).

  The reason I'm thinking about this is that reading from slot 0 is a little dangerous, it assumes there's a WT_STAT_XXX_SET call in the code that updates this specific statistic. There's nothing that enforces that convention, they could get out of sync. (And, given it's not totally insane to have both WT_STAT_XXX_SET and INCR/DECR calls mixed together, it's hard to imagine a convention that would work.)

  The change would be to remove no_aggregate and replace it with max_aggregate.

2. Most of the WT_CONNECTION statistics are not marked max_aggregate, so we generate bad code for them, for example:
{code}
to->txn_checkpoint_generation += WT_STAT_READ(from, txn_checkpoint_generation);
{code}
  It's safe because we never do anything other than WT_STAT_XXX_SET calls for those particular statistics, which clears every slot and then sets the 0 slot, but it still bugs me.

  I can imagine a future variant of WT_STAT_XXX_SET that set a value into whatever slot the session is using, and we'd pick the largest (or smallest) value from the set of values during aggregation, and then this code would break.

  As I said, this isn't a problem at the moment, but it's not right, either.

  The change would be to add max_aggregate to the WT_CONNECTION statistics where we're not aggregating values, and then add a WT_STAT_READ_MAX call that returns the max value from a set of statistics.

Message: WT-2060: Replace remaining uses of no_aggregate with max_aggregate and
remove support for no_aggregate; in the remaining no_aggregate fields
(btree_fixed_len, allocation_size, block_magic, block_major, and
block_minor), the maximum value is at least as good as the last one we
find (and in some cases, such as the file allocation size, arguably
better). The reason is because no_aggregate simply read from slot 0, and
that assumes there's a WT_STAT_XXX_SET call in the code that updates
this sp ecific statistic, and we have no way to enforce that, so don't
try. This will be marginally slower because we're checking more fields
on statistics calls, but I can't imagine it will matter.

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,

for: 3.2.9

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

bq. In the case when we're evicting pages to the LAS file are we obeying encryption?  Clearly it would be bad to save pages in the clear in the LAS file for encrypted tables. While we cannot encrypt the LAS pages with each table's individual encryptor, the LAS table should be using the connection encryptor for that data.  I cannot tell what cfg would end up in {{bt_handle.c:__btree_conf}} on the creation of the LAS file.  At line 429, it would have to make sure the {{cval.len == 0}} (i.e. it is given the empty string for {{encryption=(name=))}} or add another piece to explicitly check for the LAS.

It's a good question. Here's the interesting code from {{\_\_btree_conf}}:

{noformat}
    420 /*
    421  * We do not use __wt_config_gets_none here because ""none""
    422  * and the empty string have different meanings.  The
    423  * empty string means inherit the system encryption setting
    424  * and ""none"" means this table is in the clear even if the
    425  * database is encrypted.  If this is the metadata handle
    426  * always inherit from the connection.
    427  */
    428 WT_RET(__wt_config_gets(session, cfg, ""encryption.name"", &cval));
    429 if (WT_IS_METADATA(btree->dhandle) || cval.len == 0)
    430         btree->kencryptor = conn->kencryptor;
    431 else if (WT_STRING_MATCH(""none"", cval.str, cval.len))
    432         btree->kencryptor = NULL;
    433 else {
    434         WT_RET(__wt_config_gets_none(
    435             session, cfg, ""encryption.keyid"", &keyid));
    436         WT_RET(__wt_config_gets(session, cfg, ""encryption"", &enc));
    437         if (enc.len != 0)
    438                 WT_RET(__wt_strndup(session, enc.str, enc.len,
    439                     &enc_cfg[0]));
    440         ret = __wt_encryptor_config(session, &cval, &keyid,
    441             (WT_CONFIG_ARG *)enc_cfg, &btree->kencryptor);
    442         __wt_free(session, enc_cfg[0]);
    443         WT_RET(ret);
    444 }

And here's the interesting stack:

{noformat}

In short, we open the LAS file as part of {{wiredtiger_open()}}, we don't find ""encryption.name"" in the config, and so we inherit the {{conn->kencryptor}} value at line 430, which has already been set by {{wiredtiger_open()}}.

So, I think the right thing happens, but it's not explicitly happening. What if {{wiredtiger_open()}} doesn't set up encryption first? (Well, that can't happen, and I can't imagine it ever happening, that would be difficult to envision.)

I'm a little confused by why we're doing a check against {{WT_IS_METADATA(btree->dhandle)}}, it seems to me that is an unnecessary test because encryption.name won't be set, that is, testing {{cval.len == 0}} should be sufficient in both cases.

In summary, I'm asking why we don't do something like:

Message: WT-3100 test bug: format is weighted to delete, insert, then write operations (#3219)

test/format was weighted to delete, insert, then write operations, which meant that configuring insert=80 might have no effect, if the randomly assigned percentage of delete operations was 95.  Rewrite the code that calculates operation percentages to assign operation percentages
in a random order, add an explicit read percentage instead of making all non-allocated operations default to reads.

This is applied uniformly to all methods that return integers. 

The original authors of the compare_wrap and equals_wrap methods, however, clearly intended the result of the comparison to be returned directly. There are a couple of hints of this. There are Swig declarations to ignore/rename the methods and inside the renamed methods the logic from the output type map is duplicated. 

The current state is that when a cursor comparison returns 1, a WiredTigerException is thrown with the POSIX error string for ERRNO 1. -1 throws the Wired Tiger exception string at index -1. 0 happens to work, which might be why this was missed until now. As far as I can tell, this bug has been present since the JNI was introduced.

There are a number of ways of solving this. Some of them are more brittle / less 
performant than others. The route I've chosen to take is to avoid the typemap
by changing the return type to a long. It was the most minimally intrusive way
which had minimal performance impact. 

I'll have a pull request on GitHub ready in a few moments. Here is a commit illustrating the bug in JUnit tests.

https://github.com/mwberry/wiredtiger/commit/4d143cb4884c50e7137271b76b2ba87b95810ee1

Other options would include:
1: Stashing the default Swig typemap for int and restoring it
   at the end of the scope of the Cursor class. Any methods after
   the restoration would return integers verbatim. This method is
   brittle due to a reliance on the ordering of methods and Swig
   declarations.
2: Boxing the int return type into a capital-I Integer in Java
3: Boxing the int into a single element int[] and then unboxing in Java
4: Some other deep Swig magick to arcane for myself.

Problem is that src/include has error.h which overrides /usr/include/error.h.

Since wiredtiger_ext.h is used by external applications, it should be where wiredtiger.h is.

I understand applications should use the installed files in /usr/local but during development, tests may need to point to where wiredtiger source path for include and library.  Does that make sense?

Thanks for reporting this. We are looking into this now.

As I understand it, the only issue here for you is the conflict from WiredTiger providing an {{error.h}} file. I assume that if this was renamed to something different (say {{wt_error.h}}) this would resolve the issue for you?

Regards,
David;;;","Jul 25 2016 09:04:13 PM UTC;deyohong;Hi David,

Correct.  One way to fix it is to rename the WT error.h to something like wt_error.h.  It also seems to make sense to make wiredtiger_ext.h available for applications (i.e. not hiding in src/include), but that's up to you.

Thanks,
Deyoung;;;","Jul 27 2016 03:43:44 AM UTC;david.hows;Hi Deyoung,

We will be looking at the rename of errno.h.

In the interim, can I suggest (if you are not already) that you install libwiredtiger on your system first by running something like {{make install prefix=/path/to/local/install}}. It is not recommended to build applications against WiredTiger's source tree, but against the build and installed library + headers.

I understand that you are likely already building against an installed libwiredtiger and this issue is about reporting the naming to us, however this information is for future users who may run into like issues.

Thanks,
David;;;","Aug 15 2016 03:02:45 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'keithbostic', u'name': u'Keith Bostic', u'email': u'keith.bostic@mongodb.com'}

The POSIX code might be better for some people though, because I suspect most custom device APIs will be closer to POSIX than to an in-memory file system, which is what the example code implements.

Anyway, no reason not to list both, I've pushed that change.;;;","May 19 2016 04:13:14 PM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'keithbostic', u'name': u'Keith Bostic', u'email': u'keith.bostic@mongodb.com'}

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

Message: Import wiredtiger-wiredtiger-2.8.0-592-g848e5f5.tar.gz from wiredtiger branch mongodb-3.2

ref: 8b7110b..848e5f5
for: 3.2.9

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

Replace the ""Closing brackets missing from config string"" error message

many closing brackets as well as too few.

If the configuration string starts with a leading closing bracket, CAP
is called without PUSH having been called first (so out.str is never
initialized), conf.depth will be decremented to match conf.top's initial
value of -1, and we return a garbage item.

Missing a fs_directory_list_free in ex_file_system.c,WT-2782,302398,,Bug,Closed,WT,WiredTiger,software,backlog-server-storage-engines,"<p>Issues relating to the WiredTiger storage engine, independent of MongoDB.</p>

<p>If you have an issue with MongoDB running on WiredTiger, please open a <a href=""/browse/SERVER"">SERVER</a> ticket.</p>",https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger,Minor - P4,Fixed,alexander.gorrod,deyohong,deyohong,Jul 19 2016 10:02:27 PM UTC,Oct 12 2017 11:14:08 PM UTC,Dec 17 2021 05:33:27 AM UTC,Sep 13 2016 01:27:30 AM UTC,,,,3.2.10,3.3.11,WT2.9.0,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,"Using the branch 'develop.' 

I'm implementing a custom filesystem and catch this problem using code similar to ex_file_sytem.c.  I'm wondering why there is 1 missing fs_directory_list_free?

When running ex_file_system, demo_fs_directory_list_free is not called because demo_fs_directory_list calls don't match the prefix so they all returned NULL.  Not a problem there.

However, in order to see the problem, you need to change the code in demo_fs_directory_list() to always allocate entries even when there is no matching entries and count stay 0 (i.e. just so to see the missing free call), e.g.:

	allocated = 10;
	entries = calloc(allocated, sizeof(char*));
	count = 0;

And put some printf statements in both demo_fs_directory_list() and demo_fs_directory_list_free(), you will find that there is a missing demo_fs_directory_list_free() call. 

Here's the output with my printf statements showing the second WiredTigerPrepLog 0x1f26ef0 is not being freed.

I do not believe it is a bug.  When the function sends back a count of zero that means that no entries were returned.  The code (reasonably) assumes there is no need to call free.  Here is the piece of code that is doing this, from {{log_alloc_prealloc}} in log.c:
{noformat}
        /*
         * If there are no pre-allocated files, return WT_NOTFOUND.
         */
        logfiles = NULL;
        WT_ERR(__log_get_files(session, WT_LOG_PREPNAME, &logfiles, &logcount));
        if (logcount == 0)
                return (WT_NOTFOUND);
{noformat}
If you feel the documentation of those file system functions is not clear, let me know and we can add more.

Message: WT-2494: review calls to __wt_free, plus minor bug in an error path.

Remove checks for ""pointer != NULL"" before calling __wt_free(), they're
not needed.

In __wt_async_op_init(), don't bother clearing the pointer values after
calling __wt_free(), they get cleared by __wt_free().

In __lsm_tree_set_name(), don't leave the tree without a name, by freeing
the name and then failing to allocate room for the new one.

In __ckpt_last_name(), don't free the wrong pointer in the error path.

I will annotate each stat in stat_data.py with its corresponding category (all/fast/etc). stat_data.py will then be used to generate a doc listing which stat is covered in which category.
Apart from that, I will write a test/script to check if each stat is really collected as categorised in stat_data.py

To find the details of the statistics you can look at the [WiredTiger API|http://source.wiredtiger.com/develop/group__wt.html] in the documentation:
* When configured with ""fast"" statistics, all except the ones that say ""only reported if statistics=all is set"" in their description are collected
* When configured with ""all"" statistics, all of the statistics are collected.

Note: After the fix makes it to the develop branch, documentation takes a day to get auto updated.;;;",Sep 05 2016 10:57:36 AM UTC;omishchuk;Thanks!;;;,"Sep 08 2016 07:35:35 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'sulabhM', u'name': u'Sulabh Mahajan', u'email': u'sulabh.mahajan@mongodb.com'}

Message: WT-2674 simplify metadata file check (#2763)

Message: WT-2871 __wt_verbose has the wrong GCC format attributes (#2995)

Fix the __wt_verbose() attributes specfically (the argument numbering
was wrong)

Fix setting GCC attributes in inline function include files in general:
we don't parse the included inline function files to create prototypes,
additionally, add a specific function prototype with the correct form
of the GCC attribute.

Fix a few problems that have crept in over time.

We currently make an all-or-nothing decision when loading updates from the LAS table: if the on-page value is globally visible, we ignore all of the LAS table updates for that value. If the on-page value isn't globally visible, we load all the LAS table updates for that value. However, there's a middle ground: we could call {{\_\_wt_update_obsolete_check()}} on the LAS table updates and discard any of them that aren't necessary.

There are probably workloads where it would help, and given that using the lookaside table implies we're already experiencing cache pressure, it might be a change worth making.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-08-04 06:57:54.0,136080000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,jocelyn.del-prado(jocelyn.del-prado),Thu Aug 24 13:53:55 UTC 2017,,,,,,,,,,alexander.gorrod(alexander.gorrod),keith.bostic(keith.bostic),ramon.fernandez(ramon.fernandez),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|htc9h3:,,,,,,0|i21ld3:,"9,22337203685478E+018",,,,,,,Storage 2017-08-21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|htbvjr:,"Aug 04 2017 06:57:54 AM UTC;alexander.gorrod;I've opened this ticket since the first attempt at merging led to a stress test failure:

NULL is tainted? I'm hoping that using a strlen() call to figure out the

When appending a new WT_UPDATE structure to a list, there should be a
barrier to ensure the WT_UPDATE structure is fully initialized before
it's appended to the list, it can be read by other threads as soon as

Both the develop branch and this ticket's branch dynamically create eviction threads.  This ticket's branch does so very dynamically.  Develop adds them if needed in {{evict_pass}}.  I am able to reproduce the latency issues seen in Jenkins with the branch but develop also shows many, if smaller, latency messages.  What I saw was pretty interesting.

In running the {{evict-btree-stress-multi.wtperf}} workload, I see a number of multi-second latencies:
{noformat}
... [many excluded for brevity, the latter ones were the multi-second ones]
WARNING: max latency exceeded: threshold 250000 read max 1270553 insert max 0 update max 1576996
WARNING: max latency exceeded: threshold 250000 read max 411295 insert max 0 update max 422830
WARNING: max latency exceeded: threshold 250000 read max 409566 insert max 0 update max 417425
WARNING: max latency exceeded: threshold 250000 read max 2007838 insert max 0 update max 1772688
WARNING: max latency exceeded: threshold 250000 read max 4307983 insert max 0 update max 5270156
WARNING: max latency exceeded: threshold 250000 read max 3493311 insert max 0 update max 3468015
WARNING: max latency exceeded: threshold 250000 read max 531365 insert max 0 update max 531156
{noformat}

This workload runs for 10 minutes.  The interesting thing is that after that last line shown, there are no more warnings.  All of those occur in the first 4 minutes of the test.  Then there are no warnings for the remaining 6 minutes.  Looking at the new branch statistics I see eviction threads being created and removed as needed in the first 4 minutes.  For the last 6 minutes of the test, all 4 eviction threads stayed in existence and no warnings happened.

So, I made a small experimental change to the {{develop}} code to start all eviction threads in {{wt_evict_create}}.  I've now had a few runs of the same workload and not a single latency message!  There was no difference in the performance numbers.  I think having the additional threads at the beginning means we're not being reactionary and they're immediately available.;;;","Oct 03 2016 01:18:29 PM UTC;sue.loverso;I ran over the weekend with a min/max of 2/10 eviction threads on the branch.  The stress test appears to be sensitive to dropping the Linux cache via {{echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches}}.  When I drop the cache I don't see any latency warnings on develop (with the standard 4 threads) and I only saw two, just barely over the 250 msecs, on the branch (with 10 threads).  When I run with 10 threads without dropping the cache I see a 90% drop in throughput and every 5-second report includes a high latency warning.  This is probably affecting the Jenkins runs also.;;;",Oct 04 2016 12:38:44 AM UTC;sue.loverso;[~fedorova] The workloads I've been running and the Jenkins runs are showing this change to be performance neutral.  What workloads and under what circumstances (like hardware) have you seen performance increases?  My AWS box and the Jenkins have 8 cores and 32Gb.;;;,"Oct 04 2016 06:04:11 AM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], if you take a workload where the number of eviction workers is configured well, then this branch is not expected to improve the performance. It will improve the performance in cases where the number of eviction workers was not chosen well. For example, there was a workload that you flagged a couple of months ago where having four eviction workers was worse than two eviction workers. For a workload like that the new branch would figure out that two is better than four and will settle on the better number. In other words, this takes a guesswork out of configuring the number of workers. ;;;","Oct 05 2016 06:30:16 PM UTC;sue.loverso;Sasha and I talked today about the status of this branch.  She is going to run with the heavy eviction workload {{evict-btree-stress-multi.wtperf}} (adjusted for more than 4 threads (like 10 or 20), with some warmup) and see if she can recreate some of the longer latencies shown by Jenkins when running this branch, relative to develop.

I am going to run this branch with MongoDB with some of the recent workloads that were having eviction issues.  In particular the standalone version of the insert test from SERVER-23622.  I'm going to run it in three forms:
* Current mongoDB and current WT develop
* MongoDB with max 20 eviction threads and WT develop
* MongoDB with max 20 eviction threads and wt-2898 branch;;;","Oct 05 2016 08:02:13 PM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], as I was  trying to reproduce high latencies, I observed an interesting result. In my first attempt I ran on a machine with 24 cores and 64 GB of RAM. I ran out of RAM fs, because there’s no SSD drive on that machine and the regular disk is quite slow. I saw ~156K read ops/second with the dynamic-worker branch and only about 87K read ops/second with the develop branch. There was only one eviction thread created by the dynamic-worker branch (configured with max=4), while the develop branch had four threads (also configured with max=4). I know that this does not relate to the problem we are chasing, but I just wanted to share this result with you. This machine has NUMA and 24 cores, so synchronization is very expensive. Dynamic-worker branch is dynamically adjusting to that and is running with a very low eviction thread numbers and getting twice the throughput than the configuration with a static number of eviction workers as a result. Something to keep in mind as this might be very useful for customers using machines with many cores.  ;;;","Oct 05 2016 11:43:06 PM UTC;fedorova;As I was investigating latency spikes, I observed a very interesting phenomenon. Take a look at these numbers for the evict-btree-stress-multi test:

||   || develop || dynamic-workers ||
| Read Throughput (ops/sec) | 73,424 | 127,537 |
| Update Throughput (ops/sec) | 18,356 | 31,885 |
| Num latency warnings |5 | 6 |
| Worst latency reported | 0.5 seconds  | 1.5 seconds |
| Num pages evicted by application threads | 6,767,750 | 38,459,822 |
| Num active eviction workers |4 |~2 |

1. Though we do see latency warnings in both branches, they are much worse in the dynamic-workers branch.
2. At the same time, the throughput is MUCH BETTER in the dynamic-workers branch!

The reason is that the dynamic-workers branch is much more cautious at creating additional eviction workers, and as a result we have less contention and a higher throughput. At the same, time, because there are fewer eviction workers in the dynamic-workers run, application threads are doing all the work! Hence, higher latencies!

We need a solution so that we can get rid of the latencies in the application without sacrificing throughput. As you can see from the numbers, develop branch loses  54% in read throughput and 42% is update throughput! I think we need to work out a way to make application threads less eager to help with eviction. I'll try a few things and let you know how it goes. 
;;;","Oct 06 2016 12:15:36 AM UTC;sue.loverso;That is all very interesting Sasha!  I did not see such large differences in numbers even when running with 4 workers as the max.  Perhaps because I'm running on only 8 cores.  When application threads help with eviction, they're only evicting one page and then returning.  The higher latencies for app threads tend to come when eviction is needed but there is no work available.;;;","Oct 06 2016 05:54:19 AM UTC;alexander.gorrod;Thanks [~sasha]; those are compelling numbers.

bq. The higher latencies for app threads tend to come when eviction is needed but there is no work available.

The other thing that can cause a long latency is reconciling a large page. We have some heuristics limiting which threads evict large pages, but perhaps they need to be tuned.

The changes in WT-2920 added a pair of new statistics that might be interesting for this work. They track the amount of time applications threads spend waiting on cache, and how much time they spend doing eviction.;;;","Oct 06 2016 07:53:23 PM UTC;fedorova;[~alexander.gorrod], [~sue.loverso], I was wrong about my hypothesis that if application threads were less eager about helping with eviction they will see lower latencies. I experimented wit this idea and did not see any improvements. 

At the same time, I am unable to reproduce the situation where the dynamic-workers branch has higher latencies than the develop branch. I observe similar latencies, but higher throughput with the dynamic-workers branch. I would appreciate any tips on how to reproduce that behaviour. Perhaps I should run on the same AWS instance? 

On a different note, I saw in one contrived scenario that the dynamic-workers branch did not create worker threads aggressively enough. I will investigate why. Furthermore, I would like to investigate whether latency spikes occur because the eviction server is not generating the work quickly enough or because the I/O system locks up in the kernel. I will keep you posted.;;;","Oct 07 2016 08:10:48 PM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], [~alexander.gorrod], take a look at the latest commits here https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/pull/3039.
I changed to logic of how we add/remove worker threads to be more aggressive: we add and remove threads in batches as opposed to one by one. This will help in cases where we are seeing lots of noise in the system, such as when there's tons of threads and the I/O system is very stressed. With incremental changes of one worker at a time, it was difficult to gauge the effects of adding/removing workers. Here are some numbers from my system with 24 cores, 32GB of RAM and a mechanical drive. (Note that I'm seeing latency warnings with both develop and this branch. Because the disk I have is very slow I am unable to run this workload without latency warnings).

||   || develop 4 workers || develop 20 workers || dynamic-workers aggressive ||
| Read Throughput (ops/sec) | 72,722 | 121,627 | 117,776 |
| Update Throughput (ops/sec) | 18,181 | 30,406 | 29,442 |
| Num latency warnings |5 | 6 | 7 |
| Worst latency reported | 1.1 seconds  | 0.7 seconds | 0.7 seconds |
| Average latency (us) | 1021 | 807 | 688 |

You can see that dynamic-workers beats develop with default 4 workers. If we are lucky to know in advance the best worker configuration (20), then configuring develop with that number of workers gives us a slightly better throughput, but worse latencies.  I am curious how this version fares on the tests you were previously running, which flagged higher latencies on this branch than on develop.
;;;","Oct 07 2016 08:35:00 PM UTC;sue.loverso;I am currently running the new version of the branch against develop with MongoDB with the SERVER-23622 workload.  This is a heavy insert workload interacting with checkpoints.  A diagnostic version before your change showed current MongoDB/develop (with 4 eviction threads) as the best performer compared to MongoDB/develop with 20 eviction threads and MongoDB with max 20 eviction and the branch.  The current MDB/develop was about 11% faster than either 20-thread version, on my 8 core machine.

I am rerunning with your new changes and a production version.  I will let you know what I see.

Your results are promising.  I suspect the extra eviction threads but also having available cores helps.  With 8 cores, should I rerun with a max of 8?;;;","Oct 07 2016 08:46:52 PM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], the dynamic workers branch should be able to settle on the best number of workers. That's the idea behind it: we should not have to guess how many to configure. So I'd say set the max to 20. If we are not able to come close to the hand-tuned configuration, I will need to improve the algorithm. ;;;","Oct 07 2016 08:58:02 PM UTC;sue.loverso;On this 8 core system and a production build of WiredTiger, the MongoDB+4/develop is only 3.5% faster than the MongoDB+20/branch on this particular workload.  I may spin up my old 16-core SSD AWS box on Monday for an hour and see how it fares with double the cores.  This is an insert-only workload.  I have not looked at the stats in timeseries to see what eviction workers and the eviction stats look like.  I do have them all.

[~alexander.gorrod] Do you know of other MongoDB workloads from tickets that I could try that stress out eviction in different ways?  A read-only workload or read/update instead of just insert?;;;","Oct 10 2016 04:50:07 AM UTC;alexander.gorrod;bq. Do you know of other MongoDB workloads from tickets that I could try that stress out eviction in different ways? A read-only workload or read/update instead of just insert?

The workloads I use for this sort of testing with MongoDB are YCSB. It doesn't necessarily correspond with what users do, but it does stress the system. The Jenkins YCSB job may be a good starting point: http://build.wiredtiger.com:8080/job/mongodb-perf-ycsb-develop/

It seems to me as though the primary difference between the results is likely to be the hardware. I'd be interested to know if you see different results on a larger AWS instance type (maybe and i2.4xlarge or r3.8xlarge).;;;","Oct 11 2016 05:56:02 PM UTC;sue.loverso;I ran on my hi1.4xlarge SSD with 16 cores.  Running the SERVER-23622 workload with default mongoDB and develop with 4 eviction threads compared to mongoDB with a max 20 eviction threads with the branch.  I see no performance difference in a 40 minute run.

Also on that box, I ran the {{evict-btree-stress-multi.wtperf}} workload with the same 3 combinations that Sasha ran.  I see:
|| || develop 4 || develop 20 || dynamic 20 ||
| read throughput | 51k ops/sec | 102k ops/sec | 88k ops/sec |
| update throughput | 12.8k ops/sec | 25.6k ops/sec | 21.8k ops/sec |
| num latency warnings | 4 | 1 | 0 |
| max latency seen | 930 msec | 615 msec | 237 msec|

[~fedorova] and [~alexander.gorrod] going forward with this branch means:
#  We need to take a pass through all the wtperf configurations to change those where it is appropriate from, say, 4 max eviction workers to a larger number, maybe 20.  
# We need to look at modifying the mongoDB setting they use (4) and see the impact.
# Should we change the WT default and maximum values?
;;;",Oct 12 2016 07:15:20 AM UTC;fedorova;I'd like  to investigate why we don't get close to develop 20 in throughput on this workload. Latency numbers are looking good though. I'd like to understand whether there is an inherent latency/throughput tradeoff here or we can do better in throughput without hurting latency. ;;;,"Oct 13 2016 01:24:53 AM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso] I found and fixed a few bugs in the eviction worker tuning logic. Could you please retest on your instance again, as I did not manage to get myself access on a similar instance yet? Would be great to see what the throughput and latencies look like. I don't expect to see huge changes, but you never know. I will investigate the causes for long tail latencies in the meantime.;;;","Oct 13 2016 05:15:11 AM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], I ran evict-btree-stress-multi on Alex's c3.4xlarge  (16 cores, 30GB RAM, SSD) with the latest changes to the dynamic-workers branch. Here are my results:

|| || develop 4 || develop 20 || dynamic 20 ||
| read throughput | 76k ops/sec | 129k ops/sec | 125k ops/sec |

| num latency warnings | 3 | 4 | 6 |
| max latency seen | 344 msec | 409 msec | 445 msec|

As you can see, the throughput is now in line with the best statically tuned worker settings. The reason is as follows: I realized that the previous incarnation algorithm was more aggressive about removing workers than about adding them. I have changed the algorithm so we are equally likely to either add or remove threads based on previous performance. 

We also see that as the throughput increased latency increased too. There could be a trade-off. I need to investigate how this relationship works a bit more. 

It occurred to me that tuning might be more precise if we use the degree of lock contention as the statistic behind the tuning decisions as opposed to the number of pages evicted per second. However, this statistic is more difficult to obtain, so I'd like to first see if the current version is good enough for us, for the sake of keeping the code simpler. ;;;","Oct 13 2016 07:26:00 PM UTC;sue.loverso;FYI, I reran with the new changes on my 16 core SSD.  I got interesting results.  I see pretty much the exact same results that I posted earlier.  Same throughput, no latency warnings, etc.  Looking at the statistics, the algorithm quickly starts 9 additional eviction workers, and the test runs the entire time with 10.  It never removes any.

Let me know if you want the stats file.;;;","Oct 13 2016 08:30:17 PM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], I am surprised that the algorithm never adds or removes any threads. The algorithm is currently tuned to avoid making immediate changes if the previous action (addition or removal) did not result in performance improvement or degradation. However, every 10 seconds it will randomly try to either add or remove threads, so that we don't get stuck in a bad configuration if the workload has changed.

The branch ran 10% slower.  I have attached the two directories with the stats files.  Note that {{WT.20.dev}} crossed an hour time-boundary so there are two stats files there.;;;,"Oct 29 2016 10:25:27 PM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], thanks for these stats. The logic is behaving as expected now. The reason why wt-2898 is 10% slower than develop is because it is actively tuning the number of workers all throughout the execution, to avoid getting stuck if the workload has changed or if there was noise in  measurements. That is why, with wt-2898 we are running with 16 workers on average, while manually configured develop runs with 20. 20 happens to work best for this workload, so develop is faster. I don't expect a dynamic algorithm to outperform the best static configuration for this stable workload. That being said, I am going to see if I can make the tuning algorithm smarter without adding much complexity, so the overhead of dynamic adjustment is not that great. ;;;","Nov 02 2016 12:10:58 AM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], I confirmed that when 20 workers is the optimal for the workload, and we set 20 to be the upper bound for the dynamic branch, it won't actually use 20 workers on average, because it is actively trying to add/reduce workers to avoid getting stuck in a configuration if the workload has changed. I gave the dynamic branch the maximum of 30 workers, and it now performs almost identically to the develop branch configured with the statically optimal number of workers. On my MacOS, where the number of eviction workers makes little difference, the dynamic branch settled to about 6 workers. On Alex's c3.4xlarge, where 20 workers is the best static configuration, the dynamic branch ran with about 23 workers. On my MacOS I get ~116K read ops/sec for both develop and the dynamic branch on the evict-tree-stress-multi test. On Alex's c3.4xlarge I get 151k and 149k read ops/second with the develop and the dynamic branch respectively. 

My conclusion is that if we want to have the upper bound of 20 workers in reality, we should give the dynamic branch a slightly higher upper bound, so it has the chance to actually settle on 20. ;;;","Nov 02 2016 06:58:53 PM UTC;sue.loverso;[~fedorova] and I talked today.  The branch is looking good.  Here are the next steps:
* Sasha will modify the {{wtperf}} configurations to use more eviction threads to allow the dynamic algorithms to work.
* Once those changes are committed on the branch I will point Jenkins at that branch to see the effect on the plots.
* Sasha will also do her own experiments with the {{500m*}} configurations to see long term effects and to help determine what the default value and the maximum value should be for the {{evict=(threads_max=)}} configuration setting.
* Once we have that information we'll see where we are.;;;","Nov 03 2016 09:46:19 PM UTC;fedorova;[~sue.loverso], I have changed the defaults in the dynamic branch, so we can experiment with the dynamic branch on all wtperf workloads. Now the maximum number of eviction threads is set to 30 in all wtperf workloads that have that setting. The default for the max eviction workers is also 30, so if a workload configures nothing that would be the maximum. What this means is that  the dynamic branch will have a room to configure the number of workers between 1 and 30. I am not done running my tests with these new values, but they are taking a while, so I was hoping you could switch Jenkins to that branch and see if there are any problems, so I can address everything that we find at once. ;;;",Nov 04 2016 11:56:16 AM UTC;sue.loverso;[~fedorova] the pull request tests have failed or aborted.

It is on par in those benchmarks, were the number of eviction workers is already manually tuned well (evict-btree is one example). The dynamic branch automatically finds the right number of workers, so it performs just as well. If we were running in the situation where we didn’t have a chance to manually tune the number of workers (an unknown workload), the dynamic branch would perform better for workloads where the number of eviction workers matters, because it would find the right number automatically. For some benchmarks, where the number of eviction workers is  not manually tuned well, such as medium-lsm-compact, small-lsm and evict-lsm with four threads, the performance with dynamic branch is better.

There are a couple of cases I wanted to bring to your attention: 

update-lsm.wtperf appeared to have lower read/update throughput than develop. However, when I started testing I realized that this workload has a lot of variance (you will see it just looking at the Jenkins plots). If we run the workload many times (e.g., at least 4), the performance is on par with develop.

evict-btree-stress-multi.wtperf has more latency warnings than develop, but it’s performance, both read and update throughput, are 30% BETTER than develop. So I don’t know how to play the card here. My gut feeling is that we will sacrifice throughput if we reduce latency (I saw this trade-off in my earlier tuning efforts): is that what we want to do? Since latency warnings appear in all branches, I could investigate them separately. I just don’t know if it’s worthwhile to tune the dynamic algorithm to cater to this particular benchmark. WDYT?

Overall, I am happy with the branch. After many iterations, the algorithm ended up being very simple, so it’s easy to reason about and I am not worried that it will accidentally screw up.

How do you think we should proceed with this branch? Happy to chat on hangout.

* Removed verbose message, because we already have a statistic tracking evictions per second, so this is probably redundant.

* whitespace

* KNF

* More aggressive addition/removal of eviction workers. We used to add/remove them one at a time; it's difficult to see the effects of extra workers with such an incremental change, because eviction throughput is affected by other noise, such as what happens in the kernel and in the I/O system. Now we add and remove eviction workers in batches.

* Style fixes.

* Fix compiler warning.

* Simplified the tuning logic. Addressed Sulabh's comments.

* A tuning parameter change

* Fixed a bug where we needed a random value, but were not getting it via the random number generator, so it was not random and the code did not have the right behaviour. Added stats.

* Move the call to tune evict workers into __evict_pass, so we can begin the tuning earlier.

* NOT READY FOR REVIEW. Changed defaults for the number of eviction workers, so I can experiment with larger values.

* NOT READY FOR REVIEW. A parameter to put a cap on how many threads we are adding at a time.

* Reverse the changes of the last commit. That change hurt performance.

* Changed all wtperf runners that set eviction thread maximum to 30, so we could evaluate the effects of the dynamic branch.

* Updated the number reserved for internal sessions to 40, since we can now create up to 30 eviction worker threads by default.

* Fix spellchecker complaints

* KNF

* NOT READY FOR REVIEW. Revised the algorithm to settle on a good value of evict workers once we sufficiently explore the configuration space using the gradient descent approach with random adjustments. The algorithm successfully finds the best static number of workers, but performs works. I suspect that there is an issue with how threads are removed. Suspect a bug in thread support code. Have not chased it yet.

* Remove prints, add stats.

* Fix a copy-paste bug where a code line was inadvertently eliminated.

* Reduce the maximum for eviction workers to 30. Prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer if we dynamically grow a thread group after we've shrunk it and freed the associated memory.

* Cleaned up and simplified the code.

* NOT READY FOR REVIEW. A new version of the tuning algorithm that fixes a memory issue when we try to pre-allocate a large eviction thread group. Still need to tune and clean up the code.

* Clean up the code.

* Get rid of s_label warnings. Remove unused code.

* Fix various style errors.

* Fixed the logic in figuring out the maximum value for eviction threads upon cache creation or reconfiguration, which had caused a crash in one of the tests.

* Changed default max for the number of eviction threads to eight.

* Fix ranges for the minimum number of eviction threads

* Fix eviction thread ranges to make the csuite happy

* Commit automatic changes by s_all

* Review: KNF, whitespace and renamed a few things.

* Fix lock usage

* Style police

* Fixup merge issue and compiler warning

* Sulab and David do a review!

* Fix compiler warning. Not ready for review. There is a performance regression after merging with develop. I'm on it.

* Conversion to signed values in percent calculation to make sure that we always correctly compute percent difference, which can be negative, regardless of how the complier performs sign extension. Change thresholds so we have less churn.

* Fix more compiler warnnings. Sorry about the churn, I don't see the same failures locally as on the autobuild even though I compile with -Werror.

* Replace 1/0 with true/false

* More compiler warning and style fixes. Configured with --enable-strict, so hopefully I have caught everything this time.

* Updated the number reserved for internal sessions to 40, since we can now create up to 30 eviction worker threads by default.

* Fix spellchecker complaints

* KNF

* NOT READY FOR REVIEW. Revised the algorithm to settle on a good value of evict workers once we sufficiently explore the configuration space using the gradient descent approach with random adjustments. The algorithm successfully finds the best static number of workers, but performs works. I suspect that there is an issue with how threads are removed. Suspect a bug in thread support code. Have not chased it yet.

* Remove prints, add stats.

* Fix a copy-paste bug where a code line was inadvertently eliminated.

* Reduce the maximum for eviction workers to 30. Prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer if we dynamically grow a thread group after we've shrunk it and freed the associated memory.

* Cleaned up and simplified the code.

* NOT READY FOR REVIEW. A new version of the tuning algorithm that fixes a memory issue when we try to pre-allocate a large eviction thread group. Still need to tune and clean up the code.

* Clean up the code.

* Get rid of s_label warnings. Remove unused code.

* Fix various style errors.

* Fixed the logic in figuring out the maximum value for eviction threads upon cache creation or reconfiguration, which had caused a crash in one of the tests.

* Changed default max for the number of eviction threads to eight.

* Fix ranges for the minimum number of eviction threads

* Fix eviction thread ranges to make the csuite happy

* Commit automatic changes by s_all

* Review: KNF, whitespace and renamed a few things.

* Fix lock usage

* KNF

My suggestion would be to configure WiredTiger with a superset of the features used by MongoDB (i.e., builtin snappy, zlib).

[~donald.anderson], is this something you can take?;;;","Oct 17 2016 03:02:25 PM UTC;donald.anderson;[~michael.cahill], I've got it, thanks.;;;","Mar 06 2017 07:15:46 PM UTC;donald.anderson;As I'm creating a pull request, here are some general notes on what I've learned.

The pip installer prefers to build ""wheels"", which are pre-built binaries, and then install from the wheel. This presumably would allow either us or a third party to cache a bunch of pre-built wheels for various systems, and a developer can do a quick install with the pre-built stuff.  To get the installation of an extension (i.e. a shared library) to work in the wheel framework requires Python to 'own' the complete build of the system - you hand it a set of C files and CFLAGS and it does the compilation, runs SWIG on its interface file, and links the whole thing. That's unlikely to work for us - we use autoconf to determine various flags, and certain Makefiles may override CFLAGS etc. Getting that shoehorned into Python's setup seems like a maintenance nightmare. There may be some way around this, I've tried some approaches without success so far. You can build intermediate results (like our wiredtiger .so library), you just can't get them installed in the distribution.  The next thing to try is to make a static archive full of .o's compiled with -fpic, and use that in the SWIG build.

However, there seems to be a workaround. When the pip install gets a 'bdist_wheel' build failure, it falls back to a different install method that doesn't have such onerous restraints. With this, I've built a setup that successfully configures/compiles/swigs/links/installs on the target machine.  It runs small programs, like ex_stat.py, ex_access.py). The ugly thing is that when doing 'pip install', you get a nasty error message before it succeeds.  Running the installer like this: ""pip install --no-binary :all: wiredtiger-2.9.2.tar.gz"" will make it install without errors.

One goal was to include snappy and zlib. To that end, this installer requires that snappy and zlib be built and installed on the target machine.  There must also be a snappy header file available for the compilation to work, that might be weird for a Python developer to deal with. I've thought that we might want to either bundle snappy sources into our installer, or (better) make a separate snappy installer. Presumably there could be a way to make our installer conditional so the developer can choose whether or not snappy and/or zlib are configured.

I went a short journey down the road of trying to make this work with Python3.  The setup/distribution part works, and with some small tweaks to *packing.py files, it gets past the wiredtiger_open(), but the first use of cursors causes some problems in decoding the packed data. I think the problems are probably in SWIG interface code, which is creating Python strings for data read from .wt files; in Python3 I think Python byte arrays need to be created. That seems like a tractable project, but beyond the scope of this JIRA.  For now, the setup script will reject running under Python3 to avoid any confusion.;;;","Mar 16 2017 08:29:53 PM UTC;donald.anderson;I was able to deal with the problem above.  Basically I let python 'own' the building of the library, but it only builds one C file - the generated SWIG file.  The rest of the wiredtiger library is linked in.  The key was to use the regular wiredtiger configure/make system to build a static (.a) library, but set the CFLAGS to turn on -fpic, so the archive contents can be dragged into the resulting shared library.  So wiredtiger configure/Makefiles are still used to owns its part of the build, and python setup really does the last linking step.  The pull request has more details.;;;","Mar 16 2017 08:46:16 PM UTC;donald.anderson;The {{pip_setup.py}} script in the pull request generates a source distribution.  Here's the steps to get the distribution install on pypi so it's downloadable by anyone.  I've tested this procedure using the test site testpypi.python.org.  We'll want to do this after a release is cut.  If it's done in a development tree, the version numbers will reference the next (non-existent) version.

  $ cd lang/python
  $ python2.7 pip_setup.py sdist   # creates dist/wiredtiger-2.9.2.tar.gz
  $ tar -xvzf dist/wiredtiger-2.9.2.tar.tz wiredtiger-2.9.2/wiredtiger.egg-info/PKG-INFO

At this point, we'll use instructions from this page: https://packaging.python.org/distributing/#register-your-project.  The first option in those instructions is the one that will work for us.  We're also using instructions from https://wiki.python.org/moin/TestPyPI .

Next step is to modify your ~/.pypirc to add:
{quote}
[distutils]
index-servers=
    pypi
    testpypi

[testpypi]
repository = https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
username = <your user name goes here>
password = <your password goes here>

[pypi]
repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username = <your user name goes here>
password = <your password goes here>
{quote}
Register at both testpypi and pypi to get username/password. You can also leave password blank in .pypirc , and it will be prompted when needed.  Note that testpypi and pypi have separate username databases, you must register at both. testpypi empties their username database periodically, may have to reregister at a later date if it's still helpful having a practice run.

The next steps can be done either using the testpypi site (instructions in green) or the 'real' pypi site (instructions in red).

{color:green}
First here's how to do this to test out the procedure using the testpypi.python.org site. 

Login to testpypi and use the form:  https://testpypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=submit_form .  Use that page to upload the PKG-INFO file extracted above in lang/python/wiredtiger-2.9.2/wiredtiger.egg-info/PKG-INFO

Then:
{quote}
   $ twine upload dist/wiredtiger-*.tar.gz -r testpypi
{quote}
It can be installed with:
{quote}
   $ pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi wiredtiger
{quote}
or better, within a virtual environment:
{quote}
   $ virtualenv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   (vv) $ pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi wiredtiger
{quote}
{color}

{color:red}
Here's how to do that same procedure for real, using the pypi.python.org site. 
Login to pypi and use the form:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=submit_form . Use that page to upload the PKG-INFO file extracted above in lang/python/wiredtiger-2.9.2/wiredtiger.egg-info/PKG-INFO

There are 5 callers of the page-swap function: 2 in the walk code, 2 in the row-store search code, 1 in the column-store search code. They expect to handle following errors:

1. walk #1: handles no errors
2. walk #2: handles both restart and notfound errors
3. row-store search #1, #2 and column-store search: all handle restart errors

The underlying function:

* returns the error in the case of either restart or notfound, without discarding the originally held page,
* discards both the originally held and desired page on other error (the desired page is discarded when the desired page is successfully acquired, but the originally held page is not successfully discarded).

If the caller discards the originally held page on error, they will attempt to discard an already discarded hazard pointer in cases where no page is held when the underlying function returns.

If the caller doesn't discard the originally held page on error, they will fail to discard a hazard pointer should the underlying function return a notfound or restart error they're not prepared to handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,SERVER-21808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01-05 00:20:51.0,185587200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,jocelyn.del-prado(jocelyn.del-prado),Fri Jan 29 19:25:59 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,xgen-internal-githook(xgen-internal-githook),keith.bostic(keith.bostic),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hriwhz:,,,,,,0|i1cl3j:,"9,22337203685478E+018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hrinkn:,"Jan 05 2016 12:20:51 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'keithbostic', u'name': u'Keith Bostic', u'email': u'keith@wiredtiger.com'}

The atomic operation results in 13% fewer operations being completed during the test.  If an increment gets lost because it is not atomic and/or two threads use the same value, that is okay and does not affect test correctness.

I pushed a branch in #3650 that avoids the need for locking in format by storing the last-committed timestamp in per-thread memory, and having the thread that updates the oldest timestamp sweep the per-thread memory for the lowest committed value.

To clarify why I think we should do more work here. I'm worried because we're currently single-threading commits in format, and I believe commit does too much work to serialize it.
{quote}

I like the idea of optimizing the code to allow more concurrency, but to be clear the implementation [~sulabh.mahajan] added took a read lock around commit - it only synchronized via a write lock when periodically updating the oldest ID. I'm a little concerned that the scheme you implemented will let the ID lag more, and thus get the cache stuck more often - it might be interesting to capture cases where the ID isn't being updated even though 15 seconds has elapsed (i.e: it's not moving forward).

bq. We could do something similar in timestamp_abort, if people like this approach.

It makes sense for them both to use the same scheme. I'd hoped to be able to abstract out the implementation and share it amongst test programs, but that made the task much bigger.;;;",Sep 12 2017 07:43:55 PM UTC;sue.loverso;There is a PR open for this approach and I added modifications to {{timestamp_abort}} following a similar structure.  In my runs of {{timestamp_abort}} removing the lock restored all the performance from before the merge of WT-3512.  I tested with/without the atomic operation and that made no statistical difference once the lock was gone so I left it in.;;;,"Oct 03 2017 01:46:28 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{'email': 'alexander.gorrod@mongodb.com', 'name': 'Alex Gorrod', 'username': 'agorrod'}

Message: WT-2767 in test/suite/run.py, add -s N option to run an individual scenario (#2878)

* Added -s N option to run.py to restrict run to a scenario with a
given number or name. When printing the name of the test, if there
is a scenario, print as 'fulltestname -s scenario_number' so it can be
easily copied for another command run.  Created a 'testname.txt' file
in the test directory with the name of the test (and '-s NNN', if appropriate).
Fixed the ordering of the symbolic name of a scenario (e.g. 'file.recno.hex'),
it was reversed before.

* Only allow -s when a test is specified (not for a complete run).

Message: WT-2767 in test/suite/run.py, add -s N option to run an individual scenario (#2878)

* Added -s N option to run.py to restrict run to a scenario with a
given number or name. When printing the name of the test, if there
is a scenario, print as 'fulltestname -s scenario_number' so it can be
easily copied for another command run.  Created a 'testname.txt' file
in the test directory with the name of the test (and '-s NNN', if appropriate).
Fixed the ordering of the symbolic name of a scenario (e.g. 'file.recno.hex'),
it was reversed before.

* Only allow -s when a test is specified (not for a complete run).

If you can't figure out how to test {{upgrade}} via Python, maybe you could add it to the Jenkins compat jobs?;;;","Jan 05 2017 04:27:25 AM UTC;david.hows;Shall do.

Interestingly, it appears that {{upgrade}} is a NOOP, for now. 

I will still focus on getting it added to the compat job(s), as that seems the right place for it and this will mean we get coverage the moment that this changes.;;;","Jan 12 2017 05:10:16 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'daveh86', u'name': u'David Hows', u'email': u'howsdav@gmail.com'}

Message: WT-3292 review/cleanup full-barrier calls in WiredTiger (#3395)

* Rework logging's log_close_fh and log_close_lsn barrier code. There are two fields, the close handle and the close LSN, and they both have to be set.  The __log_file_server() code was checking the close handle and then spinning until the close LSN was set, but a simpler solution is to publish the close LSN write before setting the close handle.

  To be clear, the previous code was correct, it was the comment that was wrong.

* Remove barriers from around read/write of WT_TXN_GLOBAL.checkpoint_running.  The read-barrier in __compact_checkpoint() isn't needed because the check is on memory declared volatile. The full-barrier in __txn_checkpoint_wrapper isn't needed because there's no ordering constraint.

* Don't flush the reset of the WT_REF.state field, we've never seen any performance reason that a barrier is needed.

* Fix a comment: technically, the las-was-written flag has to be flushed before any relevant read happens, document it that way.

* Instead of explicitly flushing the clear of the WT_CONN_SERVER_LSM flag, change __wt_sleep() to imply a barrier, there are loops which don't have no other barriers, like __lsm_manager_run_server().

cur_backup.c/__backup_uri() setting log-only return value,WT-2135,231434,,Bug,Closed,WT,WiredTiger,software,backlog-server-storage-engines,"<p>Issues relating to the WiredTiger storage engine, independent of MongoDB.</p>

<p>If you have an issue with MongoDB running on WiredTiger, please open a <a href=""/browse/SERVER"">SERVER</a> ticket.</p>",https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger,Minor - P4,Fixed,sue.loverso,keith.bostic,keith.bostic,Sep 24 2015 08:37:40 PM UTC,Oct 12 2017 11:12:48 PM UTC,Dec 17 2021 05:33:28 AM UTC,Nov 16 2015 02:38:46 AM UTC,,,,WT2.7.0,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,"Two issues in {{cur_backup.c/__backup_uri()}}.

First, in this code:
{code}
/*
 * Handle log targets.  We do not need to go through the
 * schema worker, just call the function to append them.
 * Set log_only only if it is our only URI target.
 */
if (WT_PREFIX_MATCH(uri, ""log:"")) {
        if (target_list == 0)
                *log_only = 1;
        else
                *log_only = 0;
        WT_ERR(__wt_backup_list_uri_append(
            session, uri, NULL));
} else
        WT_ERR(__wt_schema_worker(session,
            uri, NULL, __wt_backup_list_uri_append, cfg, 0));
{code}

I believe we won't correctly handle the case of a {{log:}} prefix followed by another target, that is, if {{log:}} is the prefix for the first of several targets, we'll set {{log_only}} the first time through the loop, and not reset it when we find additional targets.

Second, {{backup_uri()}} takes the {{WT_CURSOR_BACKUP *cp}} argument, but the only thing it does is set {{cb->list_next}} as part of a for loop, it's a pretty strange side-effect, and should probably move elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,SERVER-21549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-11-16 02:38:30.0,191721600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,jocelyn.del-prado(jocelyn.del-prado),Thu Nov 19 14:42:01 UTC 2015,,,,,,,,,,xgen-internal-githook(xgen-internal-githook),keith.bostic(keith.bostic),sue.loverso(sue.loverso),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hrt3qv:,,,,,,0|i1apin:,"9,22337203685478E+018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hslbdz:,"Nov 16 2015 02:38:30 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'sueloverso', u'name': u'Susan LoVerso', u'email': u'sue@wiredtiger.com'}

Message: WT-3287 Remove some WiredTiger internal panic checks (#3391)

* API_SESSION_INIT is only called from two places, API_CALL_NOCONF and
API_CALL, both of which include identical checks on the connection's
panic state and WT_VERB_API calls. Move the check and call into the
API_SESSION_INIT macro rather than repeating it. There's a semantic
change in that API_CALL will now do the WT_VERB_API call before parsing
the configuration, but that looks like a bug fix to me.

Minor API_SESSION_INIT cleanup, there's no need to terminate with a
semi-colon or backslash escape the last line in the macro.

Remove WT_SESSION_CHECK_PANIC() calls only intended to avoid threads
hanging inside WiredTiger.

* WT-3136 bug fix: WiredTiger doesn't check sprintf calls for error return

Make a pass through the source base to check sprintf, snprintf, vsprintf
and vsnprintf calls for errors.

* A WiredTiger key is a uint64_t.
Use sizeof(), don't hard-wire buffer sizes into the code.

* More (u_int) vs. (uint64_t) fixes.

* Use CONFIG_APPEND instead of FORMAT_APPEND, it makes more sense.

* revert part of 4475ae9, there's an explicit allocation of the size of
the buffer.

* MVSC complaints:
test\format\config.c(765): warning C4018: '<': signed/unsigned mismatch
test\format\config.c(765): warning C4018: '>': signed/unsigned mismatch

* Change Windows testing shim to correctly use __wt_snprintf

* Change Windows test shim to use the __wt_XXX functions

* MSDN's _vscprintf API returns the number of characters excluding the
termininating nul byte, return that value.

bulk load and column store appends,WT-2198,237734,,Bug,Closed,WT,WiredTiger,software,backlog-server-storage-engines,"<p>Issues relating to the WiredTiger storage engine, independent of MongoDB.</p>

<p>If you have an issue with MongoDB running on WiredTiger, please open a <a href=""/browse/SERVER"">SERVER</a> ticket.</p>",https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger,Minor - P4,Fixed,keith.bostic,keith.bostic,keith.bostic,Nov 04 2015 04:15:51 PM UTC,Oct 12 2017 11:12:34 PM UTC,Dec 17 2021 05:33:28 AM UTC,Dec 09 2015 12:23:25 PM UTC,,,,WT2.8.0,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,"WiredTiger currently ignores the bulk-load flag if configured in-memory.

That's a problem for column-store objects because we ignore the key when doing a column-store bulk-load, so an application that configures in-memory and isn't setting the cursor key for the bulk-load will fail the {{WT_CURSOR.insert}} call because the key isn't set.

We could:

* make bulk-load illegal on in-memory objects,
* make bulk-load really work on in-memory objects,
* set {{WT_CURSOR_APPEND}} when opening a bulk-load column-store cursor on an in-memory table,
* detect the error and provide a better error message

I don't care much, myself.

Absent other opinions, I guess I'd make bulk-load illegal on in-memory objects because it's simplest, but if there's a reason to support bulk-load in-memory, I don't think it would be terribly difficult to do so.

I had a couple of reasons for going down the path of silently ignoring the option:

1) It gives us the opportunity to implement bulk cursors on in-memory tables in the future, without flip-flopping on the API (i.e starting with it being different for in-memory collections).
2) I didn't think there was a functional difference between bulk and non-bulk cursor semantics (I was wrong).
3) MongoDB is a current use case for wanting to use both in-memory and on-disk configurations. They use bulk load cursors, and so would need to make the code that creates bulk load cursors aware of whether they are running in-memory or not. That's not a big deal, but I figured it's generally better to keep the in-memory and on-disk functionality as similar as possible, to avoid users of the WiredTiger API needing to write more complex code.

bq. set WT_CURSOR_APPEND when opening a bulk-load column-store cursor on an in-memory table

Are there any down sides to this approach?;;;","Nov 04 2015 11:00:17 PM UTC;michael.cahill;I think ""bulk"" should work purely as a hint to WiredTiger -- we should be free to ignore it.

To make that work with column stores, I think we should require ""append"" explicitly to get the current behavior.  If we can't support column store bulk loads without append (for now), they should silently ignore ""bulk"".

I checked ""wt load"" and was surprised to find that it doesn't use a bulk cursor.  It would need to check that there are no indexes for a table, but I suspect splitting out ""append"" from ""bulk"" would make bulk loads feasible for simple tables.  I guess a user could try to load an out-of-order dump, but that seems like a sufficiently special case that we could add a command line flag to disable bulk loads.;;;","Nov 17 2015 05:51:01 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'agorrod', u'name': u'Alex Gorrod', u'email': u'alexg@wiredtiger.com'}

There is now a ticket discussing what should happen - and it isn't

First, WT_SESSION.rebalance ({{\_\_wt_bt_rebalance}} turns exclusive access on, but doesn't turn it off, so after a rebalance, the tree won't participate in normal eviction.

Second, [~michael.cahill] notes in BF-1841:

bq.  I have some doubts about the way __wt_evict_file_exclusive_on / off are structured: we want to be sure in some operations that eviction is excluded for the whole operation.

When checking if application threads should help with eviction, don't
ignore threads operating in files that can't be evicted at the moment,
only ignore threads that are operating on cache-resident files. (They
might be the same thing at the moment, but they're not the same thing
in general.)

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

It seems as though using __FUNCTION__ is an option, as it's used by [MongoDB|https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/util/destructor_guard.h#L43] and OK on Windows according to [stackoverflow|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2281970/cross-platform-defining-define-for-macros-function-and-func], though technically that's a GCC extension so more dubious than {{__func__}}.

I can see a few options:
* Remove {{__func__}} from the new macro.
* Setup some ifdefs to ensure that {{__func__}} does something sane everywhere
* Switch to using {{__FUNCTION__}} and test everywhere we build to ensure it's supported.

I'll leave it up to you to make a decision about which path you prefer. If you get a fix pushed up today, no need to revert or create a new ticket.;;;","Aug 16 2017 12:45:10 PM UTC;keith.bostic;Thank you, [~alexander.gorrod], sorry for the noise, I thought all of our Windows platforms supported {{\_\_func__}}.

I've removed {{\_\_func__}} from the macro, I'll merge once it passes the pull request tests.;;;","Aug 24 2017 01:45:50 PM UTC;ramon.fernandez;Author:{'username': u'agorrod', 'name': u'Alex Gorrod', 'email': u'alexander.gorrod@mongodb.com'}

I noticed you changed s_docs recently to use ‘cpp’.  Here’s the problem:

$ cat ../bench/wtperf/wtperf_opt.i | cpp -DOPT_DEFINE_DOXYGEN | more
….
OPTION #async_threads,  ""number of async worker threads"", # 0, unsigned int
OPTION #checkpoint_interval,
# 89 ""<stdin>""
""checkpoint every interval seconds during the workload phase."", # 120, unsigned int
….

Thread model: posix

Two things are happening:  1) cpp is injecting line number output in the middle of the OPTION statement.  and 2)  #async_threads, #0, etc. are not being stringized.

It looks like using 'clang -E’ fixes both these problems.

From what I can gather this issue relates to a deadlock between two threads.

In my local reproduction, the deadlock was between a thread running {{__drop_file}} (and thus holding the {{WT_SESSION_LOCKED_HANDLE_LIST}} lock) and a checkpoint, which was holding a dhandle exclusively and waiting on {{WT_SESSION_LOCKED_HANDLE_LIST}} to continue.

My thinking was to have the call to {{__drop_file}} require the checkpoint lock, making the drop wait until the checkpoint had processed. Unfortunately, this has lead to further problems. More to come;;;","Feb 16 2016 04:23:27 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'michaelcahill', u'name': u'Michael Cahill', u'email': u'michael.cahill@mongodb.com'}
Message: WT-2396 Grab the checkpoint lock around drops and renames.

Since database-wide checkpoints have references to all handles in the
system, drops are generally not possible during a checkpoint regardless
of this change.  This prevents a deadlock where checkpoint waits on the
handle list lock after it has some handles locked exclusive.

A better longer-term solution would be to have checkpoint gather all
handles (including locking old checkpoints) at the beginning so it
doesn't have to acquire the handle list lock after locking handles.

Message: WT-2396 Grab the checkpoint lock around drops and renames.

Since database-wide checkpoints have references to all handles in the
system, drops are generally not possible during a checkpoint regardless
of this change.  This prevents a deadlock where checkpoint waits on the
handle list lock after it has some handles locked exclusive.

A better longer-term solution would be to have checkpoint gather all
handles (including locking old checkpoints) at the beginning so it
doesn't have to acquire the handle list lock after locking handles.

Message: WT-2586: examples/ex_config is broken

The ex_config example code opens a ""config:"" URI and then does a
WT_CURSOR.next, but ""config:"" URIs don't support WT_CURSOR.next.

In 2010, the file was changed to create ""table:access"", but the cursor
URI wasn't switched to use it, it continued using ""config:"". The code
probably never worked, but when we changed the standard not-supported
cursor function to output an error message in WT-2349, the failure
became visible.

Message: WT-2586: examples/ex_config is broken

The ex_config example code opens a ""config:"" URI and then does a
WT_CURSOR.next, but ""config:"" URIs don't support WT_CURSOR.next.

In 2010, the file was changed to create ""table:access"", but the cursor
URI wasn't switched to use it, it continued using ""config:"". The code
probably never worked, but when we changed the standard not-supported
cursor function to output an error message in WT-2349, the failure
became visible.

I pushed some changes to turn off some of these tests a few days ago (and I've added the changes as links to the ticket).

I believe the problem is with small caches (1MB) and relatively large maximum leaf page sizes (64KB, 128KB), there aren't enough pages written for compaction to work, and/or eviction is forcing pages to be written before the test expects that to happen.

I'm not absolutely sure that's the case, if someone else wants to chase further, or argue we need to understand this at a deeper level, I'm willing to help or chase.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# libeatmydata
# Python testing

This means we would have to accept some longer runtime naturally.

I made a modified version of the job to test the runtimes on tinderbox. Running without libeatmydata or python, execution takes 9-10 minutes. Running the same test with ASAN takes 13 minutes. The normal Linux PR job takes 9 minutes, so without removing libeatmydata adds about a minute to execution time. 

My aim here, would be to setup the {{wiredtiger-pull-request-linux}} job to run as described. Ideally, this shouldn't add much time (around 1 min) to the overall execution time of the PR testing jobs, as the Windows tester takes 12+ minutes to execute.;;;",Jan 20 2017 04:39:35 AM UTC;david.hows;I've added ASAN testing to WiredTiger's Pull Request testing.;;;,"Jan 23 2017 10:29:42 PM UTC;david.hows;Re-opening following a failure on one of the jenkins slaves.

To do a random lookup, first choose a chunk at random, then do a random lookup in that chunk.  Use the returned key to do a {{search}} with the LSM cursor (to get the most recent version of that value and resolve tombstones).  Retry on {{WT_NOTFOUND}} rather than using {{search_near}} to avoid bias towards records adjacent to blocks of LSM tombstones.

Some skew is still possible in this scheme because chunks are different sizes and could be completely disjoint key ranges or overlap.  When opening the cursor, we could add the number of records in each chunk and choose randomly using the total number of records to account for different chunk sizes.  That will still skew towards records with multiple updates, but hopefully that will be a small effect relative to the size of the data.  This requires some care when the last chunk is growing.;;;","May 06 2016 04:28:33 AM UTC;alexander.gorrod;The MongoDB jstest at {{jstests/aggregation/bugs/server21632.js}} has been temporarily disabled until this enhancement has been done.

Message: WT-2974 lint (#3095)

__evict_stat_walk(), __wt_curstat_cache_walk(), query_docs() don't
return error values, switch to void declarations.

__evict_stat_walk() unused variable, bytes_inmem.

WT_CURSOR.{get_key,get_value} and pthread_join can all return errors,
assert they don't fail.

KNF, whitespace

Update spelling list.

Add a new test utility macro, testutil_assertfmt(), so it's possible
to assert with more expansive error messages.

I'm pretty convinced there's a bug somewhere in that ticket, but there's no proof my initial assumption (that recovery was failing, then succeeding but without recovering correctly or completely), was right. For all we know, recovery may have succeeded and recovered correctly, but there was other corruption that caused the subsequent failure.

It's probably reasonable for database recovery to panic the system, but the existing behavior is OK, too. After recovery failure, {{wiredtiger_open}} won't return a valid {{WT_CONNECTION}} handle, so it's not like the application is going to be able to proceed, regardless.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message: WT-2712 Coverity 1356928 and 1356929: ASSERT_SIDE_EFFECT (#2807)

Coverity complains:
	CID 1356929:  Incorrect expression  (ASSERT_SIDE_EFFECT)
	Assignment ""tablename = strchr(opts->uri, 58)"" has a side effect.
	This code will work differently in a non-debug build.
	90 testutil_assert((tablename = strchr(opts->uri, ':')) != 0);

I don't see it (there aren't any #ifdefs in the path to exit), my
suspicion is Coverity doesn't like side-effects in function calls
named with any variant of ""assert"".

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,

I think the approach you have taken in the pull request is heading in the right direction, but `configure.ac.in` doesn't feel like a good place to keep a set of flags. An alternative might be to use the GCC/clang `@file` option (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/9815671 and the bottom of this page https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.3/gcc/Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options).

I did a test and it ""worked for me"" with GCC and clang. I created a file called {{gcc_args.lst}} that contains:

{code}
-Wall
-Wextra
-Wpointer-arith
-Wredundant-decls
-Wshadow
-Wunused
-Wwrite-strings
-Werror
{code}

Then passed that through configure using:

{code}
../configure CFLAGS=@gcc_args.lst
{code}

We could create a set of options files in the build_posix directory and have configure select the most aggressive one that works with the selected compiler. What do you think?;;;","Jun 03 2016 12:52:10 PM UTC;keith.bostic;[~alexander.gorrod], I agree about lists in {{configure.ac.in}}, but I don't much like {{@file}}, either. I should be able to get the list from the {{build_posix}} directory.;;;","Jun 06 2016 01:44:40 AM UTC;alexander.gorrod;[~keith.bostic] You said in GitHub:

I took a look at this one, and it's not awful, a few simple fixes dropped us down to about 20 failures.

The big question is the WT_PAGE.dsk field (the on-disk page image), which is declared const. Lots of stuff (like WT_CELL references) point into that chunk of memory, and few of them are declared const. However, it turns out that field is written, there's this one overflow path where we change the disk image:

If reconciliation deleted an overflow value, but there was still a reader in the system that might need it, the on-page cell type will have been reset to WT_CELL_VALUE_OVFL_RM and we will be passed a page so we can look-aside into the cache of such values.
I kind of hate to get rid of the idea that the on-disk image isn't written, but technically, it is written, so maybe it's the right thing to do?

If we made that change, I think we could get -Wcast-qual clean. There are some other odds and ends (for example, places where we use WT_ITEM.data without acknowledging it is const), and they'll require some thought, but it's not too bad.

Note that I left -Wcast-qual on in the clang build, but as a non-fatal error, so at this point there's a lot of noise in clang 3.8's build. We should either decide to fix cast-qual or turn it off before merging this change.

My feeling about this one is that it would be really nice to be able to say that {{dsk}} images are const. Would you be OK with separating the discussion about {{WT_CELL_VALUE_OVFL_RM}} into a different JIRA ticket?;;;","Jun 06 2016 02:11:01 AM UTC;keith.bostic;[~alexander.gorrod], you said:

Message: Import wiredtiger-wiredtiger-2.8.0-592-g848e5f5.tar.gz from wiredtiger branch mongodb-3.2

ref: 8b7110b..848e5f5

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,

Message: WT-2671 dump more information about the file layout in verify debug mode (#2755)

* WT-2671: dump more information about the file layout in verify debug mode

Dump the checkpoint final and correct sizes when loading checkpoints in
verify dump_XXX mode.

Dump the checkpoint alloc, discard and avail lists when loading
checkpoints in verify dump_XXX mode.

Fix a bug, convert the count of tree pages from uint32_t to uint64_t,
there's no reason pages counts can't overflow 4B.

Fix a bug, reset the internal/leaf page counts at the end of every
checkpoint, we were doing cumulative counts.

Fix a bug, where we were using ""%03zu"" for a size_t type, fix the
dist/s_style script to catch that case.

Add a divider line between checkpoints to make it easier to read the
output.

Add a new __wt_buf_set_size() function that displays byte values in
human-readable format.

Move __wt_buf_set_printable() from btree/bt_misc.c to support/scratch.c,
it's a general-purpose function.

Rename verify debug option from ""dump_shape"" to ""dump_layout"", we're
dumping more than the tree shape now.

* Merge the two versions of the ""dump extent list"" functions, and stop
dumping all of the elements, they're far too many for that to ever be
useful again. Instead, display a list by power-of-two bucket size.

* Minor changes to make bucket sizes human readable.

* block_ext.c:1477:3: error: format '%s' expects argument of type 'char *',
but argument 3 has type 'const void *' [-Werror=format]

dist/s_style script to catch that case.

Add a divider line between checkpoints to make it easier to read the
output.

Add a new __wt_buf_set_size() function that displays byte values in
human-readable format.

Move __wt_buf_set_printable() from btree/bt_misc.c to support/scratch.c,
it's a general-purpose function.

Rename verify debug option from ""dump_shape"" to ""dump_layout"", we're
dumping more than the tree shape now.

* Merge the two versions of the ""dump extent list"" functions, and stop
dumping all of the elements, they're far too many for that to ever be
useful again. Instead, display a list by power-of-two bucket size.

* Minor changes to make bucket sizes human readable.

{code}

That isn't fair - it means that a single thread can keep pulling content into the cache, irrespective of how much the cache usage goes over the configured maximum.

This can be reproduced by running ""wt dump"" on a large table with a large cache (at least until pull request #2018 is merged in).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01-30 15:13:11.0,185500800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,jocelyn.del-prado(jocelyn.del-prado),Sat Jan 30 15:13:11 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,alexander.gorrod(alexander.gorrod),keith.bostic(keith.bostic),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hrt51j:,,,,,,0|i17ijj:,"9,22337203685478E+018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hslcaf:,"Jan 30 2016 03:13:11 PM UTC;keith.bostic;[~alexander.gorrod], this code was removed as part of SERVER-20159 ([e548f7f|https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/commit/e548f7fd29d38481d239dd7aa26a1e2e352178b6#diff-e21b7d81bc959ced41989e8a0df26d9f]).

Occasionally after non-clean shutdown (crash) {{wiredtiger_open()}} returns us {{WT_RUN_RECOVERY}} even though we don't specify {{log=(recover=error)}} config.
If I understand documentation correctly when no value for {{log=(recover)}} is given WiredTiger should perform recovery automatically if it needs to.

On next open it recovers without any problems.

Unfortunately I have no DB/test now, but maybe it's something known (already fixed)?

First, what version of WiredTiger are you testing with? And, how easy is it for you to reproduce this problem?;;;","May 25 2015 02:56:42 PM UTC;Dmitri Shubin;It was 2.6.0

I didn't try to reproduce it yet.
The only scenario I can see is to crash/kill our application and try to reopen DB.;;;","May 25 2015 03:08:25 PM UTC;Dmitri Shubin;Ok, sorry, I found the reason -- there is a {{WiredTiger.basecfg}} file with {{recover=error}} setting.
I guess it was created by {{wt}} utility.

So we need to explicitly specify {{log=(recover=on)}} to avoid such config clashes.;;;","May 25 2015 03:19:11 PM UTC;keith.bostic;[~Dmitri Shubin], if you know, can you briefly explain the workflow through which this happened? In other words, how did {{wt}} end up creating a {{basecfg}} file in a database that then caused the problem?

That way we can at least consider if there's a change we should make in order to avoid the problem in the future.

Thank you!;;;","May 25 2015 03:39:55 PM UTC;Dmitri Shubin;We disabled creation of {{WiredTiger.basecfg}} file and give all config settings explicitly using defaults where appropriate, so we usually have {{log=(recover=on)}}

But then for some reason I tried to check DB with {{wt}} and it created {{WiredTiger.basecfg}} file with contents like:
{noformat}
# Do not modify this file.
#
# WiredTiger created this file when the database was created,
# to store persistent database settings.  Instead of changing
# these settings, set a WIREDTIGER_CONFIG environment variable
# or create a WiredTiger.config file to override them.

log=(recover=error)
version=(major=2,minor=6)
{noformat}

I didn't noticed creation of that file and started getting {{WT_RUN_RECOVERY}} on open after each non-clean shutdown.;;;","May 25 2015 06:23:57 PM UTC;keith.bostic;[~Dmitri Shubin], thanks.

I think that's a bug, {{wt}} shouldn't create a base configuration file unless it's also creating the database.

[~sue.loverso], I'm not sure about the initial contents of the base configuration file when {{wt}} reasonably creates the database home, should {{recover=error}} be set?;;;","May 28 2015 11:54:08 AM UTC;keith.bostic;[~Dmitri Shubin], just FYI, the fixes for the {{wt}} utility incorrectly creating the {{WiredTiger.basecfg}} file have been merged into the WiredTiger develop branch.;;;","May 28 2015 03:49:16 PM UTC;sue.loverso;FTR, Keith and I talked and we think that, similar to other use-this-time-only config settings, the {{recover=error}} should not be stored in the base config file.;;;",May 28 2015 08:07:51 PM UTC;Dmitri Shubin;Thank you!;;;,"Jun 10 2015 09:51:52 PM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'keithbostic', u'name': u'Keith Bostic', u'email': u'keith@wiredtiger.com'}

Move the base configuration file configuration merge code into the base

I believe the signedness of the underlying type for C/C++ enums is implementation defined (might be wrong/out-of-date), despite coverity flagging it as an unsigned value. Though a good solution could involve bounding the first value of the {{op_type}} enum to 0 (before either removing the check or ignoring the error in coverity).;;;","Jul 02 2021 12:26:49 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{'name': 'Alexey Anisimov', 'email': '84690529+AlexeyAnisimovAU@users.noreply.github.com', 'username': 'AlexeyAnisimovAU'}

Variable: 'rollback_txnid' set but never used.;;;","Jun 24 2021 09:00:32 AM UTC;jeremy.thorp;The Coverity analysis is correct, and the variable *rollback_txnid* is not used after it is set. That means either (a) that the variable is not needed and can be removed, or (b) the code +should+ be using the variable but an error means that it is not.

The line where three variables, including *rollback_txnid*, are initialised is

 
{code:java}
rollback_count = rollback_msg_count = rollback_txnid = 0;
{code}
*rollback_txnid* is not used after this line.

A review of the code shows that here we have situation (a) and the variable *rollback_txnid* is not needed and so can be removed. 

Given that *-Wall* is turned on, which includes -*Werror=unused-but-set-variable*, an important question was why did the compiler not pick up this situation before it reached Coverity.

 

The C compiler treats the line

 
{code:java}
rollback_count = rollback_msg_count = rollback_txnid = 0;{code}
as equivalent to this

 

 
{code:java}
rollback_count = (rollback_msg_count = (rollback_txnid = 0));{code}
 

So, while Coverity is treating *rollback_txnid* as being unused after it is set, the compiler appears to be handling the code more simply. Because the result of *(rollback_txnid = 0)* is being assigned to *rollback_msg_count* the compiler appears to be treating it as used.

Changing the order of the chain of assignments to the following will cause a compiler error because *rollback_txnid*** is at the left and therefore the last assignment to occur:

 
{code:java}
rollback_txnid = rollback_count = rollback_msg_count =  0;{code}
 

However, putting *rollback_txnid* in the 'middle' does not cause a compiler error, as the assignment to *rollback_txn* is not the last assignment.**

 
{code:java}
rollback_count = rollback_txnid = rollback_msg_count =  0;{code}
 

So, whether the compiler displays the error is entirely dependent on the order of the variables in the assignment chain.

Initialising each variable as separate, non-chained, assignments will avoid the order dependent behaviour.;;;","Jun 28 2021 12:01:40 AM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{'name': 'Jeremy Thorp', 'email': 'jeremy.thorp@mongodb.com', 'username': 'jeremythorp'}

Therefore it may be easier to just say {{tiered\_}} everyplace.

The metadata salvage test leaves behind core files in its current working directory.  When run from {{make check all}}, e.g., during Evergreen testing, this will be the {{build_posix/test/csuite}} directory, which is also where the other {{csuite}} tests are run from.  So when the metadata salvage test finishes, it will remove its own core file(s), _as well as any left behind by other tests_.  

I'm going to change this test so that when it spawns a child process, the first thing the child does is to {{chdir}} into the appropriate database directory.  That way if/when the child dumps core it will be in a directory that the program already cleans up at the end of its run.;;;","Jun 10 2020 01:30:43 PM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{'name': 'keitharnoldsmith', 'email': '61710331+keitharnoldsmith@users.noreply.github.com', 'username': 'keitharnoldsmith'}

* WT-6392 wt4156_metadata_salvage test doesn't clean up core files properly

Have child processes chdir into database directory so any cores they leave
will removed when we delete that directory at the end of the run.

Reorganize end-of-test cleanup and comment on corefile removal.

Message: WT-5274 format.sh must handle core-dump signals and ""gdb attach"" build mode. (#5001)

* In the case of a snapshot-isolation mismatch, output a ""run failed"" message before attempting
calls that might drop core, otherwise format.sh won't detect the failure.

Turn off core dumps before attempting diagnostic dumps, they aren't useful.

Don't bother repeating the error message on exit after a snapshot-isolation failure, just die.

* The pgrep call only reports running processes, not processes that have already exited,
so format.sh wasn't ever waiting for its children. Replace pgrep calls with extraction
of the child's PID from the log file.

Add code to catch and handle when the format run is terminated by a signal that normally
indicates a hard failure, for example, a segmentation fault.

Report failure consistently in all cases.

Use a more common indentation style for the dumped log fle, prefixing lines with ""    > "".

* Sheer paranoia, skip directories without a log file, they aren't ours and we'll die
horribly if we try to handle them.

* Support wiredtiger builds with ""attach"" functionality. This requires detaching each format run
from the shell script (otherwise the script couldn't exit without killing the process), and
tracking running processes differently because once a process stops to be attached, it's no
longer counted as a running job.

Acquire the wt binary path if we're running the smoke tests, not just abort/recovery tests.

Rename ""stop"" as ""quit"", to match ""force_quit"".

Add ""--"" as an argument to separate format.sh arguments from format arguments so it's possible
to pass normal arguments (for example, ""-l"") to format.

Whitespace cleanups.

Message: WT-4557 Remove error_prefix from base configuration file, set error_prefix in wt command (#4459)

* Don't include the error_prefix configuration setting in the base
configuration file, that will set an error prefix for all future
applications running on the database.

* Set the error_prefix configuration setting in the wt command, it helps
identify where error messages are coming from.

:(

Is there any plan to support the Java API on windows?
;;;","Nov 20 2017 08:45:26 PM UTC;alexander.gorrod;We have no current plans because there has not been demand for the Java API on Windows so far. There is no technical blocker to making the Java API available on Windows.

The WiredTiger team is unlikely to have bandwidth to add support for the Java API in the immediate future, but we would be very happy to accept a community contribution that added such support. Most of the work would be in creating the necessary build files, and the steps should be similar to those used by the Python API [here|https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/develop/SConstruct];;;","Nov 21 2017 09:50:45 AM UTC;Swoop;I'm interested on this feature, so maybe can help with something.
I have take a first look at the SConstruct file, unfortunately all I can do is learn about Scons and SWIG, because never used it.

Another question, the POSIX build also uses SWIG to create the suffix *__java_ libraries, so I understand that the same file ([lang/java/wiredtiger.i|https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/develop/lang/java/wiredtiger.i]) has to be used, is that correct?

;;;",Nov 21 2017 11:03:59 PM UTC;alexander.gorrod;[~donald.anderson] Would you mind helping [~Swoop] understand what needs to be done to support Java on Windows?;;;,"Nov 22 2017 02:27:48 AM UTC;donald.anderson;[~Swoop], you are right. SWIG is used to create the C 'wrapper' code that compiles into the *_java libraries. You'll notice that we already use SWIG (on Windows and POSIX) to build Python libraries. So that might help to put together the Scons code to run SWIG for Java.;;;","Nov 22 2017 09:27:51 AM UTC;Swoop;Ok, thanks, let's see if can I do something.;;;","Nov 25 2017 05:09:11 PM UTC;Swoop;Hello again,

I'm back with good news, I was able to build the wiredtiger_java.dll
I have created a pull request [pull request (3811)|https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/pull/3811] so you can take a look and test it.

Best regards,

Paco


P.S.

SConstruct update to support building wiredtiger_java.dll.

-> wiredtiger.jar is created inside lang/java/wiredtiger.jar
-> wiredtiger_java.dll is created in root repo folder.

Usage example from cmd:
c:\Python27\python.exe c:\Python27\Scripts\scons.py --enable-java=c:/Users/paco/Downloads/swigwin-3.0.12/swig.exe,""C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_151/""

I do not know why.thank you for help;;;","Oct 25 2016 01:11:22 AM UTC;david.hows;Hi Huang Chong,

According to the commands you have run, you created a table with all the default options and did not set a table key and value format. This means that the table has [defaulted|http://source.wiredtiger.com/develop/struct_w_t___s_e_s_s_i_o_n.html#a358ca4141d59c345f401c58501276bbb] to a key_format of {{u}} and a value format of {{u}}.

As per the [documentation for the wt utility|http://source.wiredtiger.com/develop/command_line.html] the write command is limited as follows:
bq.The data source must be configured with string or record number keys and string values.

This means that the key_format must use either {{r}} or {{S}} as it's format string and the value_format must be {{S}}.

This limitation exists as the wt utility is meant to only be a limited access mechanism to perform certain offline maintainence tasks. The wt utility should not be seen as a replacement for a full application that uses libwiredtiger to access all your data.

Finally, are you following a tutorial for the steps you are using? If so, can you please provide a link to it as I would like to update the details to reflect the issues you are having.

Thanks,
David;;;","Oct 26 2016 02:56:10 AM UTC;hc990;Could u give me a demo to show how to create a object, and CURD data with wt? thx;;;","Oct 26 2016 04:03:08 AM UTC;david.hows;Hi Huang Chong,

You would be best looking over the [WiredTiger Documentation|http://source.wiredtiger.com/2.8.0/index.html] and looking at the [examples|https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/tree/master/examples] provided. These examples cover how to perform operations with WiredTiger using either the C, Java or Python API's.

I'm going to mark this issue as ""Not a Bug"" now, as there is no issue with WiredTiger itself. If you have further questions I recommend you take them to the [WiredTiger google group|groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/wiredtiger-users] as the Jira project is for WiredTiger bugs and features.

We process the results of each of the parallel command run results in a for loop. That loop calls an error-checking function that uses a case statement to exclude certain test failures from making the script error out (specifically s_export and s_tags). This case-statement inside the function issues a break (C Style), which then terminated the for-loop above the function call.

Removing this break-call and using the bash style {{;;}} end of clause seems to resolve the issue.

I also went and refactored the loop above to remove another un-needed control statement.;;;","Jan 13 2017 12:24:36 PM UTC;xgen-internal-githook;Author:{u'username': u'daveh86', u'name': u'David Hows', u'email': u'howsdav@gmail.com'}

Message: WT-3191 lint (#3310)

* WT-3191 lint

Remove WT_UNUSED(session), session is used in the function.

* Check returns from WT_CURSOR.get_value().

* Lots of the csuite test programs have ""normal"" output now, change the
testutil_die() function to include a ""FAILED"" message so it's possible
to figure it out.

Make the program name a global so we can print it out on error, add a
standard testutil_set_progname function to set the program name and
call it from everywhere.

* Lint is deeply saddened by mixing-and-matching enums and ints, use a
switch statement instead of arithmetic operations.

* Avoid enum arithmetic with minimal casting.

This change only uses the enum for one switch.

Message: WT-3191 lint (#3310)

* WT-3191 lint

Remove WT_UNUSED(session), session is used in the function.

* Check returns from WT_CURSOR.get_value().

* Lots of the csuite test programs have ""normal"" output now, change the
testutil_die() function to include a ""FAILED"" message so it's possible
to figure it out.

Make the program name a global so we can print it out on error, add a
standard testutil_set_progname function to set the program name and
call it from everywhere.

* Lint is deeply saddened by mixing-and-matching enums and ints, use a
switch statement instead of arithmetic operations.

* Avoid enum arithmetic with minimal casting.

This change only uses the enum for one switch.

Message: WT-3269 Miscellaneous cleanup (#3377)

I missed two copyright notices when updating from 2016 to 2017.

* Cleanup, one of the temporary copyright files wasn't being removed on exit.

* Don't use S2C/S2BT if there's already a local conn/btree variable.

* Fix some indentation, minor whitespace.

* clang warning: Value stored to 'pgs_evicted_cur' is never read

* __wt_thread_group_start_one and __wt_thread_group_stop_one no longer
return errors, clean up error handling and comments in
__evict_tune_workers, and __evict_tune_workers itself no longer returns
an error.

* Give test/syscall/wt2336_base/base.run a standard copyright notice,
so dist/s_copyright doesn't have to treat it as a special case.

Coverity is complaining about dead code in the new eviction code, and I think the complaint is technically correct.

Here's the code:
{noformat}
  1469  /*
  1470   * __evict_get_ref --
  1471   *      Get a page for eviction.
  1472   */
  1473  static int
  1474  __evict_get_ref(
  1475      WT_SESSION_IMPL *session, bool is_server, WT_BTREE **btreep, WT_REF **refp)
  1476  {
  ...
  1485          is_app = !F_ISSET(session, WT_SESSION_INTERNAL);
  1486          urgent_ok = (!is_app && !is_server) ||
  1487              !WT_EVICT_HAS_WORKERS(session) ||
  1488              __wt_cache_aggressive(session);
  ...
  1587                   * Don't force application threads to evict dirty pages if they
  1588                   * aren't stalled by the amount of dirty data in cache.
  1589                   */
  1590                  if (!urgent_ok && (is_server || (is_app &&
  1591                      !F_ISSET(cache, WT_CACHE_EVICT_DIRTY_HARD))) &&
  1592                      __wt_page_is_modified(evict->ref->page)) {
  1593                          --evict;
  1594                          break;
  1595                  }
{noformat}

Coverity claims that at line 1590, the {{is_app}} test is dead code, because {{is_app}} must be true.

At line 1486, {{urgent_ok}} is true if neither {{is_app}} or {{is_server}} is true.

At line 1590, to test {{is_app}}, we first know that {{urgent_ok}} is false (so one of {{is_app}} and {{is_server}} must be true), and we second know that {{is_server}} is false, else we wouldn't be testing {{is_app}}.

Is there a restructure that would make Coverity happy?

I find that pg_row_entries macro is repeated, in btmem.h line 470:
#define pg_row_entries u.row.entries

it should be

change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,

Message: Import wiredtiger-wiredtiger-2.8.0-592-g848e5f5.tar.gz from wiredtiger branch mongodb-3.2

ref: 8b7110b..848e5f5
for: 3.2.9

This commit replaces a number of previous backports with the original
change, so some of the tickets listed below may have been resolved in
previous versions already as a backport to the v3.2 branch. For example,
SERVER-24580 includes change a63e21b8 as a cherry-pick of 1f4aaa44, but
this commit replaces that change with 1f4aaa44 itself.

==23199== Your program just tried to execute an instruction that Valgrind
==23199== did not recognise.  There are two possible reasons for this.
==23199== 1. Your program has a bug and erroneously jumped to a non-code
==23199==    location.  If you are running Memcheck and you just saw a
==23199==    warning about a bad jump, it's probably your program's fault.
==23199== 2. The instruction is legitimate but Valgrind doesn't handle it,
==23199==    i.e. it's Valgrind's fault.  If you think this is the case or
==23199==    you are not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==23199== Either way, Valgrind will now raise a SIGILL signal which will

It's better to run this as {{./libtool --mode=execute valgrind examples/c/ex_all}}.

We currently turn off Python with valgrind:

# There are still problems with running valgrind on python on some of our test systems
# env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.libs $VALGRIND_CMD python ../test/suite/run.py -v 2

Currently, this test can run on 3 hosts (tinderbox, kodkod and margay) so my remaining question is whether we want this test running on aws-build-test.
