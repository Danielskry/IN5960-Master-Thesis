Rather, we want to do \nsomething \'smart\'.\n\nFirefox offers two ways to set the encoding of a query for \'search engines\' \n(actually, \'keyword bookmark\').\n\n1. If \'keyword\' is made out of an existing bookmark entry, the encoding of \nthat bookmark is used.\n\n2. A user can add \'mozcharset=<ENCODING>\' to the URL for \'keyword\'.\n\nhttp://www.foo.com/q=%s&mozcharset=Shift_JIS\n\nThe last time I checked, #1 is not possible because we keep bookmark and \nsearch engine lists separately.\n#2 is not that hard to implement, but it\'s kinda dirty hack.\n\nHowever, we can do something similar to #1 if we record ""the encoding of a \nsite"" (or a url) in history db and use that encoding for \'search engine\' \n(assuming that we can associate a site (or a url patten) with a single \nencoding).\n\nIf it\'s a new url/site,  we may fetch the page with \'%s\' replaced by \'foo\' \n(an ASCII string) in the background(?, invisible tab?) and figure out the \nencoding...\n\n\nAlternatively, instead of having the full list of encodings (supported by \nChrome), we can just list UTF-8, user-default encoding, locale-dependent \nencodings (1 - 3) and a couple of recently selected encodings (basically, \nwhat\'s listed in the second segment of Page - Encoding menu.\n\nComments from Sky:\n----------------------------\n\nFor auto-generated keywords we record the encoding at the time the\nkeyword is created. For user created keywords we don\'t do anything\nspecial. It would be nice if we could check the history db, but our db\ncurrently doesn\'t store site encodings and this wouldn\'t help first\nrun import.\n\nPerhaps for user created keywords we could set the encoding the first\ntime they use the keyword. This would mean we might get the encoding\nwrong the first time, but subsequently it should be correct.\n\nWe could certainly provide a dialog that lets users change the\nencoding, but are users really going to know how to specify encodings?\n\nComments from Peter:\n----------------------------\n\nObviously we want to use smart heuristics to guess the right encoding to \nuse.  I am still not sure we shouldn\'t give users a way to edit this \nencoding, though.  Perhaps if there are several such options we could have \na ""More..."" type of plus box at the bottom of the edit dialog that could be \nused to see advanced options like this.\n\nComments from Sky:\n----------------------------\n\nIt would be nice to show the suggest URL too. So, if we do have a\n\'more\' dialog, there is more (HA!) to add than just the encoding.\n\nComments from Jungshik:\n----------------------------\n\n>  are users really going to know how to specify encodings?\n\n\nIn CJK and some other countries, yes, many users would know :-)  Limiting \nthe selection to ~5 (the last paragraph in the previous comment) would \nhelp, too.\n\n\n\n- Show quoted text -\n> Perhaps for user created keywords we could set the encoding the first\n> time they use the keyword. This would mean we might get the encoding\n> wrong the first time, but subsequently it should be correct.\n\n\nCould we hide that first try from a user somehow? (the 2nd last paragraph \nin my previous comment)   If not, perhaps, we can set the encoding to the \ndefault encoding (that way, we have a higher chance of getting it right in \nthe 1st try) in the 1st try.\n\nStill, as Peter is pondering, we may have to provide a pull-down menu (in \n\'More ...\').\n\nComments from Sky:\n----------------------------\n\n- Hide quoted text -\n>> Perhaps for user created keywords we could set the encoding the first\n>> time they use the keyword.

I am running Fedora which I know is not ""officially"" supported for cros development. But haven\'t had issues until now. Nonetheless, I wonder if this affects other developers on other systems.\n\nBasically, the /proc mount gets hosed up outside of the chroot where  /proc/mounts, /proc/net, and /proc/self are dead links and all /proc/<pid> and other essential /proc/<stuff> are missing.  I am unable to run sudo, ps, mount and possibly other system commands.\n\nI can recover the bad state if I reboot or run ""mount -t proc proc /proc"".  However, invoking cros_sdk again just reintroduces the problem.\n\nIf I revert CL 195783 locally, then everything works great.', '']",0

But the description is longer:\n\nWe try to create pattern tiles in the screen coordinate space to avoid pixelation. Therefor we take the RenderObject of the element where we want to apply the pattern. After that we walk up the DOM Tree (render tree in reality) and consider all transformations on the road. That is done by applying all transformations (including the viewBox and transform of the pattern) to a intermediate transform. We use this transform to map the drawing rect of the tile and get the size that a tile would need on the screen.\n\nThis works almost all the time, almost. The attached example is different, since the patterns and the referenced object are in different viewports:\n\n<svg    xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" width=""500"" height=""500"" >\n\n<defs>\n<pattern  id=""P2"" patternUnits=""userSpaceOnUse"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"">\n  <rect width=""100%"" height=""100%"" fill=""url(#P1)""/>\n</pattern>\n\n<pattern  id=""P1"" patternUnits=""userSpaceOnUse"" width=""20"" height=""20"">\n  <circle id=""S1"" r=""10"" cx=""10"" cy=""10"" stroke=""black"" fill=""pink"" stroke-width=""2"" />\n</pattern>\n</defs>\n\n<svg viewBox=""0 0 100 100"" preserveAspectRatio=""none"">\n  <rect fill=""url(#P2)"" width=""100%"" height=""100%""/>\n</svg>\n</svg>\n\nThe last rect in the example above is what we see on the screen. This rect gets filled with pattern P2.\n\nP2 wants to get the tile size of the pattern. Therefor we take the object (the rect), and apply all transforms on the way up to the root. That means, we create a new AffineTransform, apply the transform of the rect (still identity matrix). After that we walk up the DOM and reach the inner SVG element. We apply the viewBox (similar to a transform) and walk up the DOM. We reach the root element and apply the transform of the root element.\n\nFor P2 we get the correct size of the tile. But the rect in pattern P2 uses a pattern P1 as well. The new pattern will take this rect to calculate the transform. The problem is, that this rect is not in the viewport of the target element. Therefor we don\'t apply the transform of the inner SVG on the way up of the DOM.\n\nThis ends up in the pixelation. We still need to consider the rect in the pattern, it\'s transform as well as the transform of the pattern. Afterwards we need the transform of the rect element, the transform of the inner SVG and at the end the root transform.\n\n================================\n\nComment #3\nPosted on 2012-02-04 08:52:39 PST by Nikolas Zimmermann (zimmermann@kde.org)\n\n(In reply to comment #2 [https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77719#c2])\n> The culprit is SVGImageBufferTools::calculateTransformationToOutermostSVGCoordinateSystem.

I think we should continue using the existing country code from prefs in this case. Just treat this case as ""country hasn\'t changed"".\n\nReason for this, is I can see a scenario where we may want to throttle geo-location server-side or the service could be having problems - where upon we will be returning empty country codes. I don\'t think these responses should trigger behavior change in clients - i.e. infrastructure issues shouldn\'t cause users\' behaviors to become flaky.\n\nAdditionally, I think we should separately have an extra pref that stores ""last non-empty country code received"" - which may be more up to date than the version-tagged one. This way, on a version upgrade - if the current seed doesn\'t have a country code (e.g. due to server-side throttling), we can still use a more up-to-date value than what corresponded to the last version number.\n\nScott, would you be able to make the above changes?
